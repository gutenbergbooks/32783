<p>While the scattered and persecuted strollers thus kept alive
something of the popularity, if not of the loftier traditions, of
their art, neither, on the other hand, was there an
utter absence of written compositions to bridge the
<span class="sidenote">Ecclesiastical and monastic literary drama.</span>
gap between ancient and modern dramatic literature.
In the midst of the condemnation with which the
Christian Church visited the stage, its professors and
votaries, we find individual ecclesiastics resorting in their
writings to both the tragic and the comic form of the ancient
drama. These isolated productions, which include the <span class="grk" title="Christos
paschôn">&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8000;&#962; &#960;&#940;&#963;&#967;&#969;&#957;</span> (<i>Passion of Christ</i>) formerly attributed to St Gregory
Nazianzen, and the <i>Querolus</i>, long fathered upon Plautus himself,
were doubtless mostly written for educational purposes&mdash;whether
Euripides and Lycophron, or Menander, Plautus and
Terence, served as the outward models. The same was probably
<span class="sidenote">Hrosvitha.</span>
the design of the famous &ldquo;comedies&rdquo; of Hrosvitha, the
Benedictine nun of Gandersheim, in Eastphalian
Saxony, which associate themselves in the history of Christian
literature with the spiritual revival of the 10th century in the
days of Otto the Great. While avowedly imitated in form from
the comedies of Terence, these religious exercises derive their
themes&mdash;martyrdoms,<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and miraculous or otherwise startling
conversions<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a>&mdash;from the legends of Christian saints. Thus,
from perhaps the 9th to the 12th centuries, Germany and France,
and through the latter, by means of the Norman Conquest,
England, became acquainted with what may be called the literary
monastic drama. It was no doubt occasionally performed by
the children under the care of monks or nuns, or by the religious
themselves; an exhibition of the former kind was that of the
<i>Play of St Katharine</i>, acted at Dunstable about the year 1110
in &ldquo;copes&rdquo; by the scholars of the Norman Geoffrey, afterwards
abbot of St Albans. Nothing is known concerning it except
the fact of its performance, which was certainly not regarded as
a novelty.</p>

<p>These efforts of the cloister came in time to blend themselves
with more popular forms of the early medieval drama. The
natural agents in the transmission of these popular
forms were those <i>mimes</i>, whom, while the representatives
<span class="sidenote">The joculatores, jongleurs, minstrels.</span>
of more elaborate developments, the &ldquo;pantomimes&rdquo;
in particular, had inevitably succumbed, the Roman
drama had left surviving it, unextinguished and unextinguishable.
Above all, it is necessary to point out how in the long interval
now in question&mdash;the &ldquo;dark ages,&rdquo; which may, from the present
point of view, be reckoned from about the 6th to the 11th century&mdash;the
Latin and the Teutonic elements of what may be broadly
designated as medieval &ldquo;minstrelsy,&rdquo; more or less imperceptibly,
coalesced. The traditions of the disestablished and disendowed
<i>mimus</i> combined with the &ldquo;occupation&rdquo; of the Teutonic <i>scôp</i>,
who as a professional personage does not occur in the earliest
Teutonic poetry, but on the other hand is very distinctly traceable
under this name or that of the &ldquo;gleeman,&rdquo; in Anglo-Saxon
literature, before it fell under the control of the Christian Church.
Her influence and that of docile rulers, both in England and in
the far wider area of the Frank empire, gradually prevailed even
over the inherited goodwill which neither Alfred nor even Charles
the Great had denied to the composite growth in which <i>mimus</i>
and <i>scôp</i> alike had a share.</p>

<p>How far the <i>joculatores</i>&mdash;which in the early middle ages came
to be the name most widely given to these irresponsible transmitters
of a great artistic trust&mdash;kept alive the usage of entertainments
more essentially dramatic than the minor varieties of
their performances, we cannot say. In different countries these
entertainers suited themselves to different tastes, and with the
rise of native literatures to different literary tendencies. The
literature of the <i>troubadours</i> of Provence, which communicated
itself to Spain and Italy, came only into isolated contact with the
beginnings of the religious drama; in northern France the
<i>jongleurs</i>, as the <i>joculatores</i> were now called, were confounded
with the <i>trouvères</i>, who, to the accompaniment of <i>vielle</i> or harp,
sang the <i>chansons de geste</i> commemorative of deeds of war.
As appointed servants of particular households they were here,
and afterwards in England, called <i>menestrels</i> (from <i>ministeriales</i>)
or <i>minstrels</i>. Such a <i>histrio</i> or <i>mimus</i> (as he is called) was
Taillefer, who rode first into the fight at Hastings, singing his
songs of Roland and Charlemagne, and tossing his sword in the
air and catching it again. In England such accomplished
minstrels easily outshone the less versatile gleemen of pre-Norman
times, and one or two of them appeared as landholders
in Domesday Book, and many enjoyed the favour of the Norman,
Angevin and Plantagenet kings. But here, as elsewhere, the
humbler members of the craft spent their lives in strolling from
castle to convent, from village-green to city-street, and there
exhibiting their skill as dancers, tumblers, jugglers proper, and
as masquers and conductors of bears and other dumb contributors
to popular wonder and merriment. Their only chance of survival
finally came to lie in organization under the protection of powerful
nobles; but when, in the 15th century in England, companies of
players issued forth from towns and villages, the profession,
in so far as its members had not secured preference, saw itself
threatened with ruin.</p>

<p>In any attempt to explain the transmission of dramatic
elements from pagan to Christian times, and the influence
exercised by this transmission upon the beginnings of
the medieval drama, account should finally be taken
<span class="sidenote">Survivals and adaptations of pagan festive ceremonies and usages.</span>
of the pertinacious survival of popular festive rites and
ceremonies. From the days of Gregory the Great, <i>i.e.</i>
from the end of the 6th century onwards, the Western
Church tolerated and even attracted to her own
festivals popular customs, significant of rejoicing,
which were in truth relics of heathen ritual. Such were the
Mithraic feast of the 25th of December, or the egg of Eostre-tide,
and a multitude of Celtic or Teutonic agricultural ceremonies.
These rites, originally symbolical of propitiation or of weather-magic,
were of a semi-dramatic nature&mdash;such as the dipping of
the neck of corn in water, sprinkling holy drops upon persons
or animals, processions of beasts or men in beast-masks, dressing
trees with flowers, and the like, but above all ceremonial dances,
often in disguise. The sword-dance, recorded by Tacitus, of
which an important feature was the symbolic threat of death to
a victim, endured (though it is rarely mentioned) to the later
middle ages. By this time it had attracted to itself a variety of
additional features, and of characters familiar as pace-eggers,
mummers, morris-dancers (probably of distinct origin), who
continually enlarged the scope of their performances, especially
as regarded their comic element. The dramatic &ldquo;expulsion of
death,&rdquo; or winter, by the destruction of a lay-figure&mdash;common
through western Europe about the 8th century&mdash;seems connected
with a more elaborate rite, in which a disguised performer
(who perhaps originally represented summer) was slain and
afterwards revived (the <i>Pfingstl</i>, Jack in the Green, or Green
Knight). This representation, after acquiring a comic complexion,
was annexed by the character dancers, who about the
15th century took to adding still livelier incidents from songs
treating of popular heroes, such as St George and Robin Hood;
which latter found a place in the festivities of May Day with their
central figure, the May Queen. The earliest ceremonial observances
of this sort were clearly connected with pastoral and
agricultural life; but the inhabitants of the towns also came
to have a share in them; and so, as will be seen later, did the
clergy. They were in particular responsible for the buffooneries
of the feast of fools (or asses), which enjoyed the greatest popularity
in France (though protests against it are on record from
the 11th century onwards to the 17th), but was well known from
London to Constantinople. This riotous New Year&rsquo;s celebration
was probably derived from the ancient Kalend feasts, which
may have bequeathed to it both the hobby-horse and the lord,
or bishop, of misrule. In the 16th century the feast of fools was
combined with the elaborate festivities of courts and cities
during the twelve Christmas feast-days&mdash;the season when throughout
the previous two centuries the &ldquo;mummers&rdquo; especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page498" id="page498"></a>498</span>
flourished, who in their disguisings and &ldquo;<i>viseres</i>&rdquo; began as
dancers gesticulating in dumb-show, but ultimately developed
into actors proper.</p>

<p>Thus the literary and the professional element, as well as that
of popular festive usages, had survived to become tributaries
to the main stream of the early Christian drama,
which had its direct source in the liturgy of the Church
<span class="sidenote">The liturgy the main source of the medieval religious drama.</span>
itself. The service of the Mass contains in itself
dramatic elements, and combines with the reading
out of portions of Scripture by the priest&mdash;its &ldquo;epical&rdquo;
part&mdash;a &ldquo;lyrical&rdquo; part in the anthems and responses
of the congregation. At a very early period&mdash;certainly
already in the 5th century&mdash;it was usual on special occasions to
increase the attractions of public worship by living pictures,
illustrating the Gospel narrative and accompanied by songs;
and thus a certain amount of action gradually introduced itself
into the service. The insertion, before or after sung portions
<span class="sidenote">Tropes.</span>
of the service, of tropes, originally one or more verses
of texts, usually serving as introits and in connexion
with the gospel of the day, and recited by the two halves of the
choir, naturally led to dialogue chanting; and this was frequently
accompanied by illustrative fragments of action, such as drawing
down the veil from before the altar.</p>

<p>This practice of interpolations in the offices of the church,
which is attested by texts from the 9th century onwards (the
so-called &ldquo;Winchester tropes&rdquo; belong to the 10th
and 11th), progressed, till on the great festivals of the
<span class="sidenote">The liturgical mystery.</span>
church the epical part of the liturgy was systematically
connected with spectacular and in some measure
mimical adjuncts, the lyrical accompaniment being of course
retained. Thus the <i>liturgical mystery</i>&mdash;the earliest form of the
Christian drama&mdash;was gradually called into existence. This had
certainly been accomplished as early as the 10th century, when
on great ecclesiastical festivals it was customary for the priests
to perform in the churches these offices (as they were called).
The whole Easter story, from the burial to Emmaus, was thus
presented, the Maries and the angel adding their lyrical <i>planctus</i>;
while the surroundings of the Nativity&mdash;the Shepherds, the
Innocents, &amp;c.&mdash;were linked with the Shepherds of Epiphany
by a recitation of &ldquo;Prophets,&rdquo; including Vergil and the Sibyl.
Before long, from the 11th century onwards, <i>mysteries</i>, as they
were called, were produced in France on scriptural subjects
unconnected with the great Church festivals&mdash;such as the Wise
and Foolish Virgins, Adam (with the fall of Lucifer), Daniel,
Lazarus, &amp;c. Compositions on the last-named two themes
remain from the hand of one of the very earliest of medieval
play-writers, Hilarius, who may have been an Englishman,
and who certainly studied under Abelard. He also wrote a
&ldquo;miracle&rdquo; of St Nicholas, one of the most widely popular of
medieval saints. Into the pieces founded on the Scripture
narrative outside characters and incidents were occasionally
introduced, by way of diverting the audience.</p>

<p>These mysteries and miracles being as yet represented by the
clergy only, the language in which they were usually written is
Latin&mdash;in many varieties of verse with occasional
prose; but already in the 11th century the further
<span class="sidenote">The collective mystery.</span>
step was taken of composing these texts in the vernacular&mdash;the
earliest example being the mystery of the
Resurrection. In time a whole series of mysteries was joined
together; a process which was at first roughly and then more
elaborately pursued in France and elsewhere, and finally resulted
in the <i>collective mystery</i>&mdash;merely a scholars&rsquo; term of course, but
one to which the principal examples of the English mystery-drama
correspond.</p>

<p>The productions of the medieval religious drama it is usual
technically to divide into three classes. The <i>mysteries</i> proper
deal with scriptural events only, their purpose being
to set forth, with the aid of the prophetic or preparatory
<span class="sidenote">Mysteries, miracles, and morals distinguished.</span>
history of the Old Testament, and more especially of
the fulfilling events of the New, the central mystery
of the Redemption of the world, as accomplished by
the Nativity, the Passion and the Resurrection. But in fact
these were not kept distinctly apart from the <i>miracle-plays</i>, or
<i>miracles</i>, which are strictly speaking concerned with the legends
of the saints of the church; and in England the name <i>mysteries</i>
was not in use. Of these species the miracles must more especially
have been fed from the resources of the monastic literary
drama. Thirdly, the <i>moralities</i>, or <i>moral-plays</i>, teach and
illustrate the same truths&mdash;not, however, by direct representation
of scriptural or legendary events and personages, but allegorically,
their characters being personified virtues or qualities. Of
the moralities the Norman <i>trouvères</i> had been the inventors;
and doubtless this innovation connects itself with the endeavour,
which in France had almost proved victorious by the end of the
13th century, to emancipate dramatic performances from the
control of the church.</p>

<p>The attitude of the clergy towards the dramatic performances
which had arisen out of the elaboration of the services of the
church, but soon admitted elements from other sources,
was not, and could not be, uniform. As the plays grew
<span class="sidenote">The clergy and the religious drama.</span>
longer, their paraphernalia more extensive, and their
spectators more numerous, they began to be represented
outside as well as inside the churches, at first in the
churchyards, and the use of the vulgar tongue came to be gradually
preferred. A Beverley Resurrection play (1220 c.) and some
others are bilingual. Miracles were less dependent on this
connexion with the church services than mysteries proper;
and lay associations, gilds, and schools in particular, soon began
to act plays in honour of their patron saints in or near their own
halls. Lastly, as scenes and characters of a more or less trivial
description were admitted even into the plays acted or superintended
by the clergy, as some of these characters came to be
depended on by the audiences for conventional extravagance or
fun, every new Herod seeking to out-Herod his predecessor, and
the devils and their chief asserting themselves as indispensable
favourites, the comic element in the religious drama increased;
and that drama itself, even where it remained associated with
the church, grew more and more profane. The endeavour to
sanctify the popular tastes to religious uses, which connects itself
with the institution of the great festival of Corpus Christi (1264,
confirmed 1311), when the symbol of the mystery of the Incarnation
was borne in solemn procession, led to the closer union
of the dramatic exhibitions (hence often called <i>processus</i>) with
this and other religious feasts; but it neither limited their range
nor controlled their development.</p>

<p>It is impossible to condense into a few sentences the extremely
varied history of the processes of transformation undergone by
the medieval drama in Europe during the two centuries&mdash;from
about 1200 to about 1400&mdash;in which it ran
<span class="sidenote">Progress of the medieval drama in Europe.</span>
a course of its own, and during the succeeding period,
in which it was only partially affected by the influence
of the Renaissance. A few typical phenomena may,
however, be noted in the case of the drama of each of the several
chief countries of the West; where the vernacular successfully
supplanted Latin as the ordinary medium of dramatic speech,
where song was effectually ousted by recitation and dialogue,
and where finally, though the emancipation was on this head
nowhere absolute, the religious drama gave place to the secular.</p>

<p>In France, where dramatic performances had never fallen
entirely into the hands of the clergy, the progress was speediest
and most decided towards forms approaching those
of the modern drama. The earliest play in the French
<span class="sidenote">France.</span>
tongue, however, the 12th-century <i>Adam</i>, supposed to have
been written by a Norman in England (as is a fragmentary
<i>Résurrection</i> of much the same date), still reveals its connexion
with the liturgical drama. Jean Bodel of Arras&rsquo; miracle-play
of <i>St Nicolas</i> (before 1205) is already the production of a secular
author, probably designed for the edification of some civic confraternity
to which he belonged, and has some realistic features.
On the other hand, the <i>Theophilus</i> of Rutebeuf (d. c. 1280) treats
its Faust-like theme, with which we meet again in Low-German
dramatic literature two centuries later, in a rather lifeless form
but in a highly religious spirit, and belongs to the cycle of
miracles of the Virgin of which examples abound throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page499" id="page499"></a>499</span>
this period. Easter or Passion plays were fully established in
popular acceptance in Paris as well as in other towns of France
by the end of the 14th century; and in 1402 the <i>Confrérie de
la Passion</i>, who at first devoted themselves exclusively to the
performance of this species, obtained a royal privilege for the
purpose. These series of religious plays were both extensive
and elaborate; perhaps the most notable series (c. 1450) is that
by Arnoul Greban, who died as a canon of Le Mans, his native
town. Its revision, by Jean Michel, containing much illustrative
detail (first performed at Angers in 1486), was very popular.
Still more elaborate is the Rouen Christmas mystery of 1474,
and the celebrated <i>Mystère du vieil testament</i>, produced at
Abbeville in 1458, and performed at Paris in 1500. Most of the
Provençal Christmas and Passion plays date from the 14th
century, as well as a miracle of St Agnes. The miracles of saints
were popular in all parts of France, and the diversity of local
colouring naturally imparted to these productions contributed
materially to the growth of the early French drama. The
miracles of Ste Geneviève and St Denis came directly home to
the inhabitants of Paris, as that of St Martin to the citizens of
Tours; while the early victories of St Louis over the English
might claim a national significance for the dramatic celebration
of his deeds. The local saints of Provence were in their turn
honoured by miracles dating from the 15th and 16th centuries.</p>

<p>It is less easy to trace the origins of the comic medieval drama
in France, connected as they are with an extraordinary variety
of associations for professional, pious and pleasurable purposes.
The <i>ludi inhonesti</i> in which the students of a Paris college
(Navarre) were in 1315 debarred from engaging cannot be proved
to have been dramatic performances; the earliest known secular
plays presented by university students in France were moralities,
performed in 1426 and 1431. These plays, depicting conflicts
between opposing influences&mdash;and at bottom the struggle between
good and evil in the human soul&mdash;become more frequent from
about this time onwards. Now it is (at Rennes in 1439) the
contention between <i>Bien-avisé</i> and <i>Mal-avisé</i> (who at the close
find themselves respectively in charge of <i>Bonne-fin</i> and <i>Male-fin</i>);
now, one between <i>l&rsquo;homme juste</i> and <i>l&rsquo;homme mondain</i>;
now, the contrasted story of <i>Les Enfants de Maintenant</i>, who,
however, is no abstraction, but an honest baker with a wife
called Mignotte. Political and social problems are likewise
treated; and the <i>Mystère du Concile de Bâle</i>&mdash;an historical
morality&mdash;dates back to 1432. But thought is taken even more
largely of the sufferings of the people than of the controversies
of the Church; and in 1507 we even meet with a hygienic or
abstinence morality (by N. de la Chesnaye) in which &ldquo;Banquet&rdquo;
enters into a conspiracy with &ldquo;Apoplexy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Epilepsy&rdquo; and
the whole regiment of diseases.</p>

<p>Long before this development of an artificial species had been
consummated&mdash;from the beginning of the 14th century onwards&mdash;the
famous fraternity or professional union of the Basoche
(clerks of the Parlement and the Châtelet) had been entrusted
with the conduct of popular festivals at Paris, in which, as of
right, they took a prominent personal share; and from a date
unknown they had performed plays. But after the <i>Confrérie de
la Passion</i> had been allowed to monopolize the religious drama,
the <i>basochiens</i> had confined themselves to the presentment of
moralities and of farces (from Italian <i>farsa</i>, Latin <i>farcita</i>), in
which political satire had as a matter of course when possible
found a place. A third association, calling themselves the
<i>Enfans sans souci</i>, had, apparently also early in the 15th century,
acquired celebrity by their performances of short comic plays
called soties&mdash;in which, as it would seem, at first allegorical
figures ironically &ldquo;played the fool,&rdquo; but which were probably
before long not very carefully kept distinct from the farces of
the Basoche, and were like these on occasion made to serve the
purposes of State or of Church. Other confraternities and
associations readily took a leaf out of the book of these devil-may-care
good-fellows, and interwove their religious and moral plays
with comic scenes and characters from actual life, thus becoming
more and more free and secular in their dramatic methods, and
unconsciously preparing the transition to the regular drama.</p>

<p>The earliest example of a serious secular play known to have
been written in the French tongue is the <i>Estoire de Griseldis</i>
(1393); which is in the style of the miracles of the Virgin, but
is largely indebted to Petrarch. The <i>Mystère du siege d&rsquo;Orléans</i>,
on the other hand, written about half a century later, in the epic
tediousness of its manner comes near to a chronicle history,
and interests us chiefly as the earliest of many efforts to
bring Joan of Arc on the stage. Jacques Milet&rsquo;s celebrated
mystery of the <i>Destruction de Troye la grant</i> (1452) seems to have
been addressed to readers and not to hearers only. The beginnings
of the French regular comic drama are again more difficult
to extract from the copious literature of farces and soties, which,
after mingling actual types with abstract and allegorical figures,
gradually came to exclude all but the concrete personages;
moreover, the large majority of these productions in their extant
form belong to a later period than that now under consideration.
But there is ample evidence that the most famous of all
medieval farces, the immortal <i>Maistre Pierre Pathelin</i> (otherwise
<i>L&rsquo;Avocat Pathelin</i>), was written before 1470 and acted by
the <i>basochiens</i>; and we may conclude that this delightful story
of the biter bit, and the profession outwitted, typifies a multitude
of similar comic episodes of real life, dramatized for the
delectation of clerks, lawyers and students, and of all lovers
of laughter.</p>

<p>In the neighbouring Netherlands many Easter and Christmas
mysteries are noted from the middle of the 15th century, attesting
the enduring popularity of these religious plays; and
with them the celebrated series of the Seven Joys of
<span class="sidenote">The Netherlands.</span>
Maria&mdash;of which the first is the Annunciation and the
seventh the Ascension. To about the same date belongs
the small group of the so-called <i>abele spelen</i> (as who should say
plays easily managed), chiefly on chivalrous themes. Though
allegorical figures are already to be found in the Netherlands
miracles of Mary, the species of the moralities was specially
cultivated during the great Burgundian period of this century
by the chambers or lodges of the <i>Rederijkers</i> (rhetoricians)&mdash;the
well-known civic associations which devoted themselves to
the cultivation of learned poetry and took an active share in the
festivals that formed one of the most characteristic features of
the life of the Low Countries. Among these moralities was that
of <i>Elckerlijk</i> (printed 1495 and presumably by Peter Dorlandus),
which there is good reason for regarding as the original of one
of the finest of English moralities, <i>Everyman</i>.</p>

<p>In Italy the liturgical drama must have run its course as
elsewhere; but the traces of it are few, and confined to the
north-east. The collective mystery, so common in
other Western countries, is in Italian literature
<span class="sidenote">Italy.</span>
represented by a single example only&mdash;a <i>Passione di Gesù Cristo</i>,
performed at Revello in Saluzzo in the 15th century; though
there are some traces of other cyclic dramas of the kind. The
Italian religious plays, called <i>figure</i> when on Old, <i>vangeli</i> when on
New, Testament subjects, and differing from those of northern
Europe chiefly by the less degree of coarseness in their comic
characters, seem largely to have sprung out of the development
of the processional element in the festivals of the Church.
Besides such processions as that of the Three Kings at Epiphany
in Milan, there were the penitential processions and songs (<i>laude</i>),
which at Assisi, Perugia and elsewhere already contained a
dramatic element; and at Siena, Florence and other centres
these again developed into the so-called (<i>sacre</i>) <i>rappresentazioni</i>,
which became the most usual name for this kind of entertainment.
Such a piece was the <i>San Giovanni e San Paolo</i> (1489), by Lorenzo
the Magnificent&mdash;the prince who afterwards sought to reform
the Italian stage by paganizing it; another was the <i>Santa
Teodora</i>, by Luigi Pulci (d. 1487); <i>San Giovanni Gualberto</i> (of
Florence) treats the religious experience of a latter-day saint;
<i>Rosana e Ulimento</i> is a love-story with a Christian moral. Passion
plays were performed at Rome in the Coliseum by the <i>Compagnia
del Gonfalone</i>; but there is no evidence on this head before the
end of the 15th century. In general, the spectacular magnificence
of Italian theatrical displays accorded with the growing pomp
of the processions both ecclesiastical and lay&mdash;called <i>trionfi</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>500</span>
already in the days of Dante; while the religious drama gradually
acquired an artificial character and elaboration of form
assimilating it to the classical attempts, to be noted below,
which gave rise to the regular Italian drama. The poetry of the
Troubadours, which had come from Provence into Italy, here
frequently took a dramatic form, and may have suggested some
of his earlier poetic experiments to Petrarch.</p>

<p>It was a matter of course that remnants of the ancient popular
dramatic entertainments should have survived in particular
abundance on Italian soil. They were to be recognized in the
improvised farces performed at the courts, in the churches (<i>farse
spirituali</i>), and among the people; the Roman carnival had
preserved its wagon-plays, and various links remained to connect
the modern comic drama of the Italians with the <i>Atellanes</i> and
<i>mimes</i> of their ancestors. But the more notable later comic
developments, which belong to the 16th century, will be more
appropriately noticed below. Moralities proper had not flourished
in Italy, where the love of the concrete has always been dominant
in popular taste; more numerous are examples of scenes, largely
mythological, in which the influence of the Renaissance is already
perceptible, of eclogues, and of allegorical festival-plays of
various sorts.</p>

<p>In Spain hardly a monument of the medieval religious drama
has been preserved. There is manuscript evidence of the 11th
century attesting the early addition of dramatic
elements to the Easter office; and a Spanish fragment
<span class="sidenote">Spain.</span>
of the Three Kings Epiphany play, dating from the 12th century,
is, like the French <i>Adam</i>, one of the very earliest examples of
the medieval drama in the vernacular. But that religious plays
were performed in Spain is clear from the permission granted
by Alphonso X. of Castile (d. 1284) to the clergy to represent
them, while prohibiting the performance by them of <i>juegos de
escarnio</i> (mocking plays). The earliest Spanish plays which we
possess belong to the end of the 15th or beginning of the 16th
century, and already show humanistic influence. In 1472 the
couplets of <i>Mingo Revulgo</i> (<i>i.e.</i> Domingo Vulgus, the common
people), and about the same time another dialogue by the same
author, offer examples of a sort resembling the Italian <i>contrasti</i>
(see below).</p>

<p>The German religious plays in the vernacular, the earliest of
which date from the 14th and 15th centuries, and were produced
at Trier, Wolfenbuttel, Innsbruck, Vienna, Berlin, &amp;c.,
were of a simple kind; but in some of them, though
<span class="sidenote">Germany.</span>
they were written by clerks, there are traces of the minstrels&rsquo;
hands. The earliest complete Christmas play in German,
contained in a 14th-century St Gallen MS., has nothing in it to
suggest a Latin original. On the other hand, the play of <i>The
Wise and the Foolish Virgins</i>, in a Thuringian MS. thought to be
as early as 1328, a piece of remarkable dignity, was evidently
based on a Latin play. Other festivals besides Christmas were
celebrated by plays; but down to the Reformation Easter
enjoyed a preference. In the same century miracle-plays began
to be performed, in honour of St Catherine, St Dorothea and
other saints. But all these productions seem to belong to a
period when the drama was still under ecclesiastical control.
Gradually, as the liturgical drama returned to the simpler forms
from which it had so surprisingly expanded, and ultimately died
out, the religious plays performed outside the churches expanded
more freely; and the type of mystery associated with the name
of the Frankfort canon Baldemar von Peterweil communicated
itself, with other examples, to the receptive region of the south-west.
The Corpus Christi plays, or (as they were here called)
<i>Frohnleichnamsspiele</i>, are notable, since that of Innsbruck (1391)
is probably the earliest extant example of its class. The number
of non-scriptural religious plays in Germany was much smaller
than that in France; but it may be noted that (in accordance
with a long-enduring popular notion) the theme of the last
judgment was common in Germany in the latter part of the
middle ages. Of this theme <i>Antichrist</i> may be regarded as an
episode, though in 1469 an <i>Antichrist</i> appears to have occupied
at Frankfort four days in its performance. The earlier (12th
century) <i>Antichrist</i> is a production quite unique of its kind;
this political protest breathes the Ghibelline spirit of the reign
(Frederick Barbarossa&rsquo;s) in which it was composed.</p>

<p>Though many of the early German plays contain an element
of the moralities, there were few representative German examples
of the species. The academical instinct, or some other influence,
kept the more elaborate productions on the whole apart from
the drolleries of the professional strollers (<i>fahrende Leute</i>), whose
Shrove-Tuesday plays (<i>Fastnachtsspiele</i>) and cognate productions
reproduced the practical fun of common life. Occasionally, no
doubt, as in the Lübeck <i>Fastnachtsspiel</i> of the Five Virtues,
the two species may have more or less closely approached to one
another. When, in the course of the 15th century, Hans Rosenplüt,
called Schnepperer&mdash;or Hans Schnepperer, called Rosenplüt&mdash;the
predecessor of Hans Sachs, first gave a more enduring form
to the popular Shrove-Tuesday plays, a connexion was already
establishing itself between the dramatic amusements of the
people and the literary efforts of the &ldquo;master-singers&rdquo; of the
towns. But, while the main productivity of the writers of
moralities and cognate productions&mdash;a species particularly suited
to German latitudes&mdash;falls into the periods of Renaissance and
Reformation, the religious drama proper survived far beyond
either in Catholic Germany, and, in fact, was not suppressed
in Bavaria and Tirol till the end of the 18th century.<a name="fa3a" id="fa3a" href="#ft3a"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>It may be added that the performance of miracle-plays is
traceable in Sweden in the latter half of the 14th century; and
that the German clerks and laymen who immigrated
into the Carpathian lands, and into Galicia in particular,
<span class="sidenote">Sweden, Carpathian lands, &amp;c.</span>
in the later middle ages, brought with them their
religious plays together with other elements of culture.
This fact is the more striking, inasmuch as, though Czech Easter
plays were performed about the end of the 14th century, we
hear of none among the Magyars, or among their neighbours of
the Eastern empire.</p>

<p>Coming now to the English religious drama, we find that from
its extant literature a fair general idea may be derived of the
character of these medieval productions. The <i>miracle-plays</i>,
<i>miracles</i> or <i>plays</i> (these being the terms used in
<span class="sidenote">Religious drama in England.</span>
England) of which we hear in London in the 12th
century were probably written in Latin and acted by
ecclesiastics; but already in the following century mention is
made&mdash;in the way of prohibition&mdash;of plays acted by professional
players. (Isolated moralities of the 12th century are not to be
regarded as popular productions.) In England as elsewhere, the
clergy either sought to retain their control over the religious
plays, which continued to be occasionally acted in churches
even after the Reformation, or else reprobated them with or
<span class="sidenote">Cornish miracle-plays.</span>
without qualifications. In Cornwall miracles in the
native Cymric dialect were performed at an early date;
but those which have been preserved are apparently
copies of English (with the occasional use of French)
originals; they were represented, unlike the English plays, in
the open country, in extensive amphitheatres constructed for
the purpose&mdash;one of which, at St Just near Penzance, has

<p>The flourishing period of English miracle-plays begins with the
practice of their performance by trading-companies in the towns,
though these bodies were by no means possessed of
any special privileges for the purpose. Of this practice
<span class="sidenote">Localities of the performance of miracle-plays.</span>
Chester is said to have set the example (1268-1276);
it was followed in the course of the 13th and 14th
centuries by many other towns, while in yet others
traces of such performances are not to be found till the
15th, or even the 16th. These towns with their neighbourhoods
include, starting from East Anglia, where the religious drama
was particularly at home, Wymondham, Norwich, Sleaford,
Lincoln, Leeds, Wakefield, Beverley, York, Newcastle-on-Tyne,
with a deviation across the border to Edinburgh and Aberdeen.
In the north-west they are found at Kendal, Lancaster, Preston,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page501" id="page501"></a>501</span>
Chester; whence they may be supposed to have migrated to
Dublin. In the west they are noticeable at Shrewsbury, Worcester
and Tewkesbury; in the Midlands at Coventry and
Leicester; in the east at Cambridge and Bassingbourne, Heybridge
and Manningtree; to which places have to be added
Reading, Winchester, Canterbury, Bethesda and London,
in which last the performers were the parish-clerks. Four
collections, in addition to some single examples of such plays,
<span class="sidenote">The York, Towneley, Chester and Coventry plays.</span>
have come down to us, the <i>York</i> plays, the so-called
<i>Towneley</i> plays, which were probably acted at the
fairs of Widkirk, near Wakefield, and those bearing the
names of <i>Chester</i> and of <i>Coventry</i>. Their dates, in the
forms in which they have come down to us, are more
or less uncertain; that of the <i>York</i> may on the whole be
concluded to be earlier than that of the <i>Towneley</i>, which were
probably put together about the middle of the 14th century; the
<i>Chester</i> may be ascribed to the close of the 14th or the earlier
part of the 15th; the body of the <i>Coventry</i> probably belongs to
the 15th or 16th. Many of the individual plays in these collections
were doubtless founded on French originals; others are taken
direct from Scripture, from the apocryphal gospels, or from the
legends of the saints. Their characteristic feature is the combination
of a whole series of plays into one <i>collective</i> whole, exhibiting
the entire course of Bible history from the creation to the day
of judgment. For this combination it is unnecessary to suppose
that they were generally indebted to foreign examples, though
there are several remarkable coincidences between the Chester
plays and the French <i>Mystère du vieil testament</i>. Indeed, the
oldest of the series&mdash;the <i>York</i> plays&mdash;exhibits a fairly close
parallel to the scheme of the <i>Cursor mundi</i>, an epic poem of
Northumbrian origin, which early in the 14th century had set
an example of treatment that unmistakably influenced the
collective mysteries as a whole. Among the isolated plays of
the same type which have come down to us may be mentioned
<i>The Harrowing of Hell</i> (the Saviour&rsquo;s descent into hell), an
East-Midland production which professes to tell of &ldquo;a strif of
Jesu and of Satan&rdquo; and is probably the earliest dramatic, or all
but dramatic, work in English that has been preserved; and
several belonging to a series known as the <i>Digby Mysteries</i>,
including <i>Parfre&rsquo;s Candlemas Day</i> (the massacre of the Innocents),
and the very interesting miracle of <i>Mary Magdalene</i>. Of the
so-called &ldquo;Paternoster&rdquo; and &ldquo;Creed&rdquo; plays (which exhibit
the miraculous powers of portions of the Church service) no
example remains, though of some we have an account; the
Croxton <i>Play of the Sacrament</i>, the MS. of which is preserved
at Dublin, and which seems to date from the latter half of the
15th century, exhibits the triumph of the holy wafer over
wicked Jewish wiles.</p>

<p>To return to the collective mysteries, as they present themselves
to us in the chief extant series. &ldquo;The manner of these
plays,&rdquo; we read in a description of those at Chester,
dating from the close of the 16th century, &ldquo;were:&mdash;Every
<span class="sidenote">English collective mysteries.</span>
company had his pageant, which pageants were
a high scaffold with two rooms, a higher and a lower,
upon four wheels. In the lower they apparelled themselves,
and in the higher room they played, being all open at the top,
that all beholders might hear and see them. The places where they
played them was in every street. They began first at the abbey
gates, and when the first pageant was played, it was wheeled
to the high cross before the mayor, and so to every street, and
so every street had a pageant playing before them at one time
till all the pageants appointed for the day were played; and
when one pageant was near ended, word was brought from
street to street, that so they might come in place thereof, exceedingly
orderly, and all the streets have their pageants afore
them all at one time playing together; to see which plays was
great resort, and also scaffolds and stages made in the streets in
those places where they determined to play their pageants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Each play, then, was performed by the representative of
a particular trade or company, after whom it was called the
fishers&rsquo;, glovers&rsquo;, &amp;c., <i>pageant</i>; while a general prologue was
spoken by a herald. As a rule the movable stage sufficed for the
action, though we find horsemen riding up to the scaffold, and
Herod instructed to &ldquo;rage in the pagond and in the strete also.&rdquo;
There is no probability that the stage was, as in France, divided
into three platforms with a dark cavern at the side of the lowest,
appropriated respectively to the Heavenly Father and his
angels, to saints and glorified men, to mere men, and to souls in
hell. But the last-named locality was frequently displayed
in the English miracles, with or without fire in its mouth. The
costumes were in part conventional,&mdash;divine and saintly personages
being distinguished by gilt hair and beards, Herod being
clad as a Saracen, the demons wearing hideous heads, the souls
black and white coats according to their kind, and the angels gold
skins and wings.</p>

<p>Doubtless these performances abounded in what seem to us
ludicrous features; and, though their main purpose was serious,
they were not in England at least intended to be
devoid of fun. But many of the features in question
<span class="sidenote">Character of the Plays.</span>
are in truth only homely and <i>naïf</i>, and the simplicity
of feeling which they exhibit is at times pathetic
rather than laughable. The occasional grossness is due to
an absence of refinement of taste rather than to an obliquity
of moral sentiment. These features the four series have more or
less in common, still there are certain obvious distinctions
between them. The <i>York</i> plays (48), which were performed
at Corpus Christi, are comparatively free from the tendency to
jocularity and vulgarity observable in the <i>Towneley</i>; several
of the plays concerned with the New Testament and early
Christian story are, however, in substance common to both
series. The <i>Towneley Plays</i> or <i>Wakefield Mysteries</i> (32) were
undoubtedly composed by the friars of Widkirk or Nostel; but
they are of a popular character; and, while somewhat over-free
in tone, are superior in vivacity and humour to both the later
collections. The <i>Chester Plays</i> (25) were undoubtedly indebted
both to the <i>Mystère du vieil testament</i> and to earlier French
mysteries; they are less popular in character than the earlier
two cycles, and on the whole undistinguished by original power
of pathos or humour. There is, on the other hand, a notable
inner completeness in this series, which includes a play of
<i>Antichrist</i>, devoid of course of any modern application. While
these plays were performed at Whitsuntide, the <i>Coventry Plays</i>
(42) were Corpus Christi performances. Though there is no proof
that the extant series were composed by the Grey Friars, they
reveal a considerable knowledge of ecclesiastical literature.
For the rest, they are far more effectively written than the
<i>Chester Plays</i>, and occasionally rise to real dramatic force.
In the <i>Coventry</i> series there is already to be observed an element
of abstract figures, which connects them with a different species
of the medieval drama.</p>

<p>The <i>moralities</i> corresponded to the love for allegory which
manifests itself in so many periods of English literature,
and which, while dominating the whole field of medieval
literature, was nowhere more assiduously and effectively
<span class="sidenote">Moralities.</span>
cultivated than in England. It is necessary to bear this in
mind, in order to understand what to us seems so strange, the
popularity of the moral-plays, which indeed never equalled
that of the miracles, but sufficed to maintain the former species
till it received a fresh impulse from the connexion established
between it and the &ldquo;new learning,&rdquo; together with the new
political and religious ideas and questions, of the Reformation
age. Moreover, a specially popular element was supplied to
these plays, which in manner of representation differed in no
essential point from the miracles, in a character borrowed from
the latter, and, in the moralities, usually provided with a companion
<span class="sidenote">The Devil and the Vice.</span>
whose task it was to lighten the weight of such abstractions
as Sapience and Justice. These were the Devil
and his attendant the <i>Vice</i>, of whom the latter seems to
have been of native origin, and, as he was usually dressed
in a fool&rsquo;s habit, was probably suggested by the familiar
custom of keeping an attendant fool at court or in great houses.
The Vice had many <i>aliases</i> (<i>Shift</i>, <i>Ambidexter</i>, <i>Sin</i>, <i>Fraud</i>,
<i>Iniquity</i>, &amp;c.), but his usual duty is to torment and tease the
Devil his master for the edification and diversion of the audience.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page502" id="page502"></a>502</span>
He was gradually blended with the domestic fool, who survived
in the regular drama. There are other concrete elements in the
moralities; for typical figures are often fitted with concrete
names, and thus all but converted into concrete human
personages.</p>

<p>The earlier English moralities<a name="fa4a" id="fa4a" href="#ft4a"><span class="sp">4</span></a>&mdash;from the reign of Henry VI.
to that of Henry VII.&mdash;usually allegorize the conflict between
good and evil in the mind and life of man, without any
side-intention of theological controversy. Such also
<span class="sidenote">Groups of English moralities.</span>
is still essentially the purpose of the extant morality
by Henry VIII.&rsquo;s poet, the witty Skelton.<a name="fa5a" id="fa5a" href="#ft5a"><span class="sp">5</span></a> <i>Everyman</i>
(pr. c. 1529), perhaps the most perfect example of its class, with
which the present generation has fortunately become familiar,
contains passages certainly designed to enforce the specific
teaching of Rome. But its Dutch original was written at least a
generation earlier, and could have no controversial intention.
On the other hand, R. Wever&rsquo;s <i>Lusty Juventus</i> breathes the
spirit of the dogmatic reformation of the reign of Edward VI.
Theological controversy largely occupies the moralities of the
earlier part of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign,<a name="fa6a" id="fa6a" href="#ft6a"><span class="sp">6</span></a> and connects itself with political
feeling in a famous morality, Sir David Lyndsay&rsquo;s <i>Satire of the
Three Estaitis</i>, written and acted (at Cupar, in 1539) on the other
side of the border, where such efforts as the religious drama
proper had made had been extinguished by the Reformation.
Only a single English political morality proper remains to us,
which belongs to the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth.<a name="fa7a" id="fa7a" href="#ft7a"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
Another series connects itself with the ideas of the Renaissance
rather than the Reformation, treating of intellectual progress
rather than of moral conduct;<a name="fa8a" id="fa8a" href="#ft8a"><span class="sp">8</span></a> this extends from the reign
of Henry VIII. to that of his younger daughter. Besides these,
there remain some Elizabethan moralities which have no special
theological or scientific purpose, and which are none the less
lively in consequence.<a name="fa9a" id="fa9a" href="#ft9a"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

<p>The transition from the morality to the regular drama in
England was effected, on the one hand, by the intermixture of
historical personages with abstractions&mdash;as in Bishop
Bale&rsquo;s <i>Kyng Johan</i> (c. 1548)&mdash;which easily led over to
<span class="sidenote">Heywood&rsquo;s interludes.</span>
the <i>chronicle history</i>; on the other, by the introduction
of types of real life by the side of abstract figures.
This latter tendency, of which instances occur in earlier
plays, is observable in several of the 16th-century
moralities;<a name="fa10a" id="fa10a" href="#ft10a"><span class="sp">10</span></a> but before most of these were written, a further
step in advance had been taken by a man of genius, John
<span class="sidenote">Transition from the morality to the regular drama.</span>
Heywood (b. c. 1500, d. between 1577 and 1587),
whose &ldquo;interludes&rdquo;<a name="fa11a" id="fa11a" href="#ft11a"><span class="sp">11</span></a> were short farces in the French
manner. The term &ldquo;interludes&rdquo; was by no means
new, but had been applied by friend and foe to religious plays,
and plays (including moralities) in general, already in the 14th
century. But it conveniently serves to designate a species
which marks a distinct stage in the history of the modern drama.
Heywood&rsquo;s interludes dealt entirely with real&mdash;very real&mdash;men
and women. Orthodox and conservative, he had at the same
time a keen eye for the vices as well as the follies of his age,
and not the least for those of the clerical profession. Other
writers, such as T. Ingeland,<a name="fa12a" id="fa12a" href="#ft12a"><span class="sp">12</span></a> took the same direction; and the
allegory of abstractions was thus undermined on the stage,
very much as in didactic literature the ground had been cut
from under its feet by the <i>Ship of Fooles</i>. Thus the interludes
facilitated the advent of comedy, without having superseded the
earlier form. Both moralities and miracle-plays survived into
the Elizabethan age after the regular drama had already begun
its course.</p>

<p>Such, in barest outline, was the progress of dramatic entertainments
in the principal countries of Europe, before the revival of
classical studies brought about a return to the examples
of the classical drama, or before this return had
<span class="sidenote">Pageants.</span>
distinctly asserted itself. It must not, however, be forgotten
that from an early period in England as elsewhere had flourished
a species of entertainments, not properly speaking dramatic,
but largely contributing to form and foster a taste for dramatic
spectacles. The <i>pageants</i>&mdash;as they were called in England&mdash;were
the successors of those <i>ridings</i> from which, when they
gladdened &ldquo;Chepe,&rdquo; Chaucer&rsquo;s idle apprentice would not keep
away; but they had advanced in splendour and ingenuity of
device under the influence of Flemish and other foreign examples.
Costumed figures represented before gaping citizens the heroes
of mythology and history, and the abstractions of moral,
patriotic, or municipal allegory; and the city of London clung
with special fervour to these exhibitions, which the Elizabethan
drama was neither able nor&mdash;as represented by most of its poets
who composed devices and short texts for these and similar shows&mdash;willing
to oust from popular favour. Some of the greatest and
some of the least of English dramatists were the ministers of
pageantry; and perhaps it would have been an advantage for
the future of the theatre if the legitimate drama and the <i>Triumphs
of Old Drapery</i> had been more jealously kept apart. With the
reign of Henry VIII. there also set in a varied succession of
entertainments at court and in the houses of the great nobles,
which may be said to have lasted through the Tudor and early
Stuart periods; but it would be an endless task to attempt to
discriminate the dramatic elements contained in these productions.
The &ldquo;mask,&rdquo; stated to have been introduced from Italy
into England as a new diversion in 1512-1513, at first merely
added a fresh element of &ldquo;disguising&rdquo; to those already in use;
as a quasi-dramatic species (&ldquo;mask&rdquo; or &ldquo;masque&rdquo;) capable of
a great literary development it hardly asserted itself till quite
the end of the 16th century.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">11. The Modern National Drama</p>

<p>The literary influence which finally transformed the growths
noticed above into the national dramas of the several countries
of Europe, was that of the Renaissance. Among the
remains of classical antiquity which were studied,
<span class="sidenote">Influence of the Renaissance.</span>
translated and imitated, those of the drama necessarily
held a prominent place. Never altogether lost sight of,
they now became subjects of devoted research and models for
more or less exact imitation, first in Greek or Latin, then in
modern tongues; and these essentially literary endeavours
came into more or less direct contact with, and acquired more or
less control over, dramatic performances and entertainments
already in existence. This process it will be most convenient
to pursue <i>seriatim</i>, in connexion with the rise and progress of the
several dramatic literatures of the West. For no sooner had the
stream of the modern drama, whose source and contributories
have been described, been brought back into the ancient bed,
than its flow diverged into a number of national currents, unequal
in impetus and strength, and varying in accordance with their
manifold surroundings. And even of these it is only possible to
survey the most productive or important.</p>

<p class="center pt2">(a) <i>Italy.</i></p>

<p>The priority in this as in most of the other aspects of the
Renaissance belongs to Italy. In ultimate achievement the
Italian drama fell short of the fulness of the results
obtained elsewhere&mdash;a surprising fact when it is
<span class="sidenote">The modern Italian drama.</span>
considered, not only that the Italian language had the
vantage-ground of closest relationship to the Latin,
but that the genius of the Italian people has at all times led it
to love the drama. The cause is doubtless to be sought in the
lack, noticeable in Italian national life during a long period, and
more especially during the troubled days of division and strife
coinciding with the rise and earlier promise of Italian dramatic
literature, of those loftiest and most potent impulses of popular
feeling to which a national drama owes so much of its strength.
This deficiency was due partly to the peculiarities of the Italian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page503" id="page503"></a>503</span>
character, partly to the political and ecclesiastical experiences
which Italy was fated to undergo. The Italians were alike
strangers to the enthusiasm of patriotism, which was as the breath
in the nostrils of the English Elizabethan age, and to the religious
devotion which identified Spain with the spirit of the Catholic
revival. The clear-sightedness of the Italians had something
to do with this, for they were too intelligent to believe in their
tyrants, and too free from illusions to deliver up their minds to
their priests. Finally, the chilling and enervating effects of a
pressure of foreign domination, such as no Western people with
a history and a civilization like those of Italy has ever experienced,
contributed to paralyse for many generations the higher efforts
of the dramatic art. No basis was permanently found for a
really national tragedy; while literary comedy, after turning
from the direct imitation of Latin models to a more popular form,
lost itself in an abandoned immorality of tone and in reckless
insolence of invective against particular classes of society.
Though its productivity long continued, the poetic drama more
and more concentrated its efforts upon subordinate or subsidiary
species, artificial in origin and decorative in purpose, and surrendered
its substance to the overpowering aids of music, dancing
and spectacle. Only a single form of the Italian drama, improvised
comedy, remained truly national; and this was of its
nature dissociated from higher literary effort. The revival of
Italian tragedy in later times is due partly to the imitation of
French models, partly to the endeavour of a brilliant genius to
infuse into his art the historical and political spirit. Comedy
likewise attained to new growths of considerable significance,
when it was sought to accommodate its popular forms to the
representation of real life in a wider range, and again to render
it more poetical in accordance with the tendencies of modern
romanticism.</p>

<p>The regular Italian drama, in both its tragic and its comic
branches, began with a reproduction, in the Latin language, of
classical models&mdash;the first step, as it was to prove, towards the
transformation of the medieval into the modern drama, and
the birth of modern dramatic literature. But the process was
both tentative and tedious, and must have died away but for the
pomp and circumstance with which some of the patrons of the
Renaissance at Florence, Rome and elsewhere surrounded these
manifestations of a fashionable taste, and for the patriotic
inspiration which from the first induced Italian writers to
dramatize themes of national historic interest. Greek tragedy
had been long forgotten, and one or two indications in the earlier
part of the 16th century of Italian interest in the Greek drama,
chiefly due to the printing presses, may be passed by.<a name="fa13a" id="fa13a" href="#ft13a"><span class="sp">13</span></a> To the
later middle ages classical tragedy meant Seneca, and even his
plays remained unremembered till the study of them was revived
by the Paduan judge Lovato de&rsquo; Lovati (Lupatus, d. 1309).
Of the comedies of Plautus three-fifths were not rediscovered
till 1429; and though Terence was much read in the schools,
he found no dramatic imitators, <i>pour le bon motif</i> or otherwise,
since Hrosvitha.</p>

<p>Thus the first medieval follower of Seneca, Albertino Mussato
(1261-1330) may in a sense be called the father of modern
dramatic literature. Born at Padua, to which city all his services
were given, he in 1315 brought out his <i>Eccerinis</i>, a Latin tragedy
very near to the confines of epic poetry, intended to warn the
Paduans against the designs of Can Grande della Scala by the
example of the tyrant Ezzelino. Other tragedies of much the
same type followed during the ensuing century; such as L. da
Fabiano&rsquo;s <i>De casu Caesenae</i> (1377) a sort of chronicle history in
Latin prose on Cardinal Albornoz&rsquo; capture of Caesena.<a name="fa14a" id="fa14a" href="#ft14a"><span class="sp">14</span></a> Purely
classical themes were treated in the <i>Achilleis</i> of A. de&rsquo; Loschi
of Vicenza (d. 1441), formerly attributed to Mussato, several
passages of which are taken verbally from Seneca; in the
celebrated <i>Progne</i> of the Venetian Gregorio Cornaro, which is
dated 1428-1429, and in later Latin productions included among
the translations and imitations of Greek and Latin tragedies
and comedies by Bishop Martirano (d. 1557), the friend of Pope
Leo X.,<a name="fa15a" id="fa15a" href="#ft15a"><span class="sp">15</span></a> and the efforts of Pomponius Laetus and his followers,
who, with the aid of Cardinal Raffaele Riario (1451-1521), sought
to revive the ancient theatre, with all its classical associations,
at Rome.</p>

<p>In this general movement Latin comedy had quickly followed
suit, and, as just indicated, it is almost impossible, when we
reach the height of the Italian Renaissance under the Medici at
Florence and at Rome in particular, to review the progress of
either species apart from that of the other. If we possessed the
lost <i>Philologia</i> of Petrarch, of which, as of a juvenile work, he
declared himself ashamed, this would be the earliest of extant
humanistic comedies. As it is, this position is held by <i>Paulus</i>,
a Latin comedy of life on the classic model, by the orthodox
P. P. Vergerio (1370-1444); which was followed by many others.<a name="fa16a" id="fa16a" href="#ft16a"><span class="sp">16</span></a></p>

<p>Early in the 16th century, tragedy began to be written in the
native tongue; but it retained from the first, and never wholly
lost, the impress of its origin. Whatever the source
of its subjects&mdash;which, though mostly of classical
<span class="sidenote">Italian tragedy in the 16th century.</span>
origin, were occasionally derived from native romance,
or even due to invention&mdash;they were all treated with
a predilection for the horrible, inspired by the example of
Seneca, though no doubt encouraged by a perennial national
taste. The chorus, stationary on the stage as in old Roman
tragedy, was not reduced to a merely occasional appearance
between the acts till the beginning of the 17th century, or ousted
altogether from the tragic drama till the earlier half of the 18th.
Thus the changes undergone by Italian tragedy were for a long
series of generations chiefly confined to the form of versification
and the choice of themes; nor was it, at all events till the last
century of the course which it has hitherto run, more than the
aftergrowth of an aftergrowth. The honour of having been the
earliest tragedy in Italian seems to belong to A. da Pistoia&rsquo;s
<i>Pamfila</i> (1499), of which the subject was taken from Boccaccio,
introduced by the ghost of Seneca, and marred in the taking.
Carretto&rsquo;s <i>Sofonisba</i>, which hardly rises above the art of a
chronicle history, though provided with a chorus, followed in
1502. But the play usually associated with the beginning of
Italian tragedy&mdash;that with which &ldquo;th&rsquo; Italian scene first learned
to glow&rdquo;&mdash;was another <i>Sofonisba</i>, acted before Leo X. in 1515,
and written in blank hendecasyllables instead of the <i>ottava</i> and
<i>terza rima</i> of the earlier tragedians (retaining, however, the lyric
measures of the chorus), by G. G. Trissino, who was employed
as nuncio by that pope. Other tragedies of the former half of
the 16th century, largely inspired by Trissino&rsquo;s example, were
the <i>Rosmunda</i> of Rucellai, a nephew of Lorenzo the Magnificent
(1516); Martelli&rsquo;s <i>Tullia</i>, Alamanni&rsquo;s <i>Antigone</i> (1532); the
<i>Canace</i> of Sperone Speroni, the envious <i>Mopsus</i> of Tasso, who,
like Guarini, took Sperone&rsquo;s elaborate style for his model; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page504" id="page504"></a>504</span>
<i>Orazia</i>, the earliest dramatic treatment of this famous subject by
the notorious Aretino (1549); and the nine tragedies of G. B.
Giraldi (Cinthio) of Ferrara, among which <i>L&rsquo;Orbecche</i> (1541)
is accounted the best and the bloodiest. Cinthio, the author of
those <i>Hecatommithi</i> to which Shakespeare was indebted for so
many of his subjects, was (supposing him to have invented these)
the first Italian who was the author of the fables of his own
dramas; he introduced some novelties into dramatic construction,
separating the prologue and probably also the epilogue
from the action, and has by some been regarded as the inventor
of the pastoral drama. But his style was arid. In the latter half
of the 16th century may be mentioned the <i>Didone</i> and the
<i>Marianna</i> of L. Dolce, the translator of Euripides and Seneca
(1565); A. Leonico&rsquo;s <i>Il Soldato</i> (1550); the <i>Adriana</i> (acted
before 1561 or 1586) of L. Groto, which treats the story of <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i>; Tasso&rsquo;s <i>Torrismondo</i> (1587); the <i>Tancredi</i> of Asinari
(1588); and the <i>Merope</i> of Torelli (1593), the last who employed
the stationary chorus (<i>coro fisso</i>) on the Italian stage. Leonico&rsquo;s
<i>Soldato</i> is noticeable as supposed to have given rise to the
<i>tragedia cittadina</i>, or domestic tragedy, of which there are few
examples in the Italian drama, and De Velo&rsquo;s <i>Tamar</i> (1586)
as written in prose. Subjects of modern historical interest were
in this period treated only in isolated instances.<a name="fa17a" id="fa17a" href="#ft17a"><span class="sp">17</span></a></p>

<p>The tragedians of the 17th century continued to pursue the
beaten track, marked out already in the 16th by rigid prescription.
In course of time, however, they sought by the
introduction of musical airs to compromise with the
<span class="sidenote">Italian tragedy in the 17th and 18th centuries.</span>
danger with which their art was threatened of being
(in Voltaire&rsquo;s phrase) extinguished by the beautiful
monster, the opera, now rapidly gaining ground in the
country of its origin. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Opera</a></span>.) To Count P. Bonarelli
(1589-1659), the author of <i>Solimano</i>, is on the other hand
ascribed the first disuse of the chorus in Italian tragedy. The
innovation of the use of rhyme attempted in the learned Pallavicino&rsquo;s
<i>Erminigildo</i> (1655), and defended by him in a discourse
prefixed to the play, was unable to achieve a permanent success
in Italy any more than in England; its chief representative
was afterwards Martelli (d. 1727), whose rhymed Alexandrian
verse (<i>Martelliano</i>), though on one occasion used in comedy by
Goldoni, failed to commend itself to the popular taste. By the
end of the 17th century Italian tragedy seemed destined to expire,
and the great tragic actor Cotta had withdrawn in disgust at the
apathy of the public towards the higher forms of the drama.
The 18th century was, however, to witness a change, the beginnings
of which are attributed to the institution of the Academy
of the Arcadians at Rome (1690). The principal efforts of the
new school of writers and critics were directed to the abolition
of the chorus, and to a general increase of freedom in treatment.
<span class="sidenote">Maffei.</span>
Before long the marquis S. Maffei with his <i>Merope</i>
(first printed 1713) achieved one of the most brilliant
successes recorded in the history of dramatic literature. This
play, which is devoid of any love-story, long continued to be
considered the masterpiece of Italian tragedy; Voltaire, who
declared it &ldquo;worthy of the most glorious days of Athens,&rdquo;
adapted it for the French stage, and it inspired a celebrated
production of the English drama.<a name="fa18a" id="fa18a" href="#ft18a"><span class="sp">18</span></a> It was followed by a tragedy
full of horrors,<a name="fa19a" id="fa19a" href="#ft19a"><span class="sp">19</span></a> noticeable as having given rise to the first Italian
dramatic <i>parody</i>; and by the highly esteemed productions of
<span class="sidenote">Metastasio.</span>
Granelli (d. 1769) and his contemporary Bettinelli. P. T.
Metastasio (1698-1782), who had early begun his career
as a dramatist by a strict adherence to the precepts of
Aristotle, gained celebrity by his contributions to the operatic
drama at Naples, Venice and Vienna (where he held office as
<i>poeta cesareo</i>, whose function was to arrange the court entertainments).
But his <i>libretti</i> have a poetic value of their own;<a name="fa20a" id="fa20a" href="#ft20a"><span class="sp">20</span></a> and
Voltaire pronounced much of him worthy of Corneille and of
Racine, when at their best. The influence of Voltaire had now
come to predominate over the Italian drama; and, in accordance
with the spirit of the times, greater freedom prevailed in the choice
of tragic themes. Thus the greatest of Italian tragic poets.
<span class="sidenote">Alfieri.</span>
Count V. Alfieri (1749-1803), found his path prepared
for him. Alfieri&rsquo;s grand and impassioned treatment of
his subjects caused his faultiness of form, which he never
altogether overcame, to be forgotten. His themes were partly
classical;<a name="fa21a" id="fa21a" href="#ft21a"><span class="sp">21</span></a> but the spirit of a love of freedom which his creations<a name="fa22a" id="fa22a" href="#ft22a"><span class="sp">22</span></a>
breathe was the herald of the national ideas of the future.
Spurning the usages of French tragedy, his plays, which abound
in soliloquies, owe part of their effect to an impassioned force of
declamation, part to those &ldquo;points&rdquo; by which Italian acting
seems pre-eminently capable of thrilling an audience. He has
much besides the subjects of two of his dramas<a name="fa23a" id="fa23a" href="#ft23a"><span class="sp">23</span></a> in common with
Schiller, but his amazon-muse (as Schlegel called her) was not
schooled into serenity, like the muse of the German poet. Among
his numerous plays (21), <i>Merope</i> and <i>Saul</i>, and perhaps <i>Mirra</i>,
are accounted his masterpieces.</p>

<p>The political colouring given by Alfieri to Italian tragedy
reappears in the plays of U. Foscolo and A. Manzoni, both of
whom are under the influence of the romantic school
of modern literature; and to these names must be
<span class="sidenote">Tragedians since Alfieri.</span>
added those of S. Pellico and G. B. Niccolini (1785-1861),
Paolo Giacometti (b. 1816) and others, whose
dramas<a name="fa24a" id="fa24a" href="#ft24a"><span class="sp">24</span></a> treat largely national themes familiar to all students
of modern history and literature. In their hands Italian tragedy
upon the whole adhered to its love of strong situations and
passionate declamation. Since the successful efforts of G.
Modena (1804-1861) renovated the tragic stage in Italy, the
art of tragic acting long stood at a higher level in this than
in almost any other European country; in Adelaide Ristori
(Marchesa del Grillo) the tragic stage lost one of the greatest
of modern actresses; and Ernesto Rossi (1827-1896) and
Tommaso Salvini long remained rivals in the noblest forms of
tragedy.</p>

<p>In comedy, the efforts of the scholars of the Italian Renaissance
for a time went side by side with the progress of the popular
entertainments noticed above. While the <i>contrasti</i> of
the close of the 15th and of the 16th century were
<span class="sidenote">Italian comedy; popular forms.</span>
disputations between pairs of abstract or allegorical
figures, in the <i>frottola</i> human types take the place of
abstractions, and more than two characters appear. The <i>farsa</i>
(a name used of a wide variety of entertainments) was still under
medieval influences, and in this popular form Alione of Asti
(soon after 1500) was specially productive. To these popular
diversions a new literary as well as social significance was given by
the Neapolitan court-poet Sannazaro (c. 1492); about the same
time a <i>capitano valoroso</i>, Venturino of Pesara, first brought on
the modern stage the <i>capitano glorioso</i> or <i>spavente</i>, the military
braggart, who owed his origin both to Plautus<a name="fa25a" id="fa25a" href="#ft25a"><span class="sp">25</span></a> and to the
Spanish officers who abounded in the Italy of those days. The
popular character-comedy, a relic of the ancient <i>Atellanae</i>,
likewise took a new lease of life&mdash;and this in a double form.
The <i>improvised</i> comedy (<i>commedia a soggetto</i>) was now as a rule
performed by professional actors, members of a <i>craft</i>, and was
<span class="sidenote">Commedia dell&rsquo; arte.</span>
thence called the <i>commedia dell&rsquo; arte</i>, which is said to
have been invented by Francesco (called Terenziano)
Cherea, the favourite player of Leo X. Its scenes, still
unwritten except in skeleton (<i>scenario</i>), were connected together
by the ligatures or links (<i>lazzi</i>) of the <i>arlecchino</i>, the descendant
of the ancient Roman <i>sannio</i> (whence our <i>zany</i>). Harlequin&rsquo;s
summit of glory was probably reached early in the 17th century,
when he was ennobled in the person of Cecchino by the emperor
Matthias; of Cecchino&rsquo;s successors, Zaccagnino and Truffaldino,
<span class="sidenote">Masked comedy.</span>
we read that &ldquo;they shut the door in Italy to good harlequins.&rdquo;
Distinct from this growth is that of the <i>masked</i>
comedy, the action of which was chiefly carried on by certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page505" id="page505"></a>505</span>
typical figures in masks, speaking in local dialects,<a name="fa26a" id="fa26a" href="#ft26a"><span class="sp">26</span></a> but which
was not improvised, and indeed from the nature of the case
hardly could have been. Its inventor was A. Beolco of Padua,
who called himself Ruzzante (joker), and is memorable under
that name as the first actor-playwright&mdash;a combination of
extreme significance for the history of the modern stage. He
published six comedies in various dialects, including the Greek of
the day (1530). This was the masked comedy to which the
Italians so tenaciously clung, and in which, as all their own and
imitable by no other nation, they took so great a pride that
even Goldoni was unable to overthrow it. Improvisation and
burlesque, alike abominable to comedy proper, were inseparable
from the species.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Latin imitations of Roman, varied by occasional
translations of Greek, comedies early led to the production
of Italian translations, several of which were performed
at Ferrara in the last quarter of the 15th century,
<span class="sidenote">Early Italian regular comedy.</span>
whence they spread to Milan, Pavia and other towns
of the north. Contemporaneously, imitations of Latin
comedy made their appearance, for the most part in rhymed
verse; most of them applying classical treatment to subjects
derived from Boccaccio&rsquo;s and other <i>novelle</i>, some still mere
adaptations of ancient models. In these circumstances it is all
but idle to assign the honour of having been &ldquo;the first Italian
comedy&rdquo;&mdash;and thus the first comedy in modern dramatic
literature&mdash;to any particular play. Boiardo&rsquo;s <i>Timone</i> (before
1494), for which this distinction was frequently claimed, is to a
large extent founded on a dialogue of Lucian&rsquo;s; and, since some
of its personages are abstractions, and Olympus is domesticated
on an upper stage, it cannot be regarded as more than a transition
from the moralities. A. Ricci&rsquo;s <i>I Tre Tiranni</i> (before 1530)
seems still to belong to the same transitional species. Among
the earlier imitators of Latin comedy in the vernacular may be
noted G. Visconti, one of the poets patronized by Ludovico il
Moro at Milan;<a name="fa27a" id="fa27a" href="#ft27a"><span class="sp">27</span></a> the Florentines G. B. Araldo, J. Nardi, the
historian,<a name="fa28a" id="fa28a" href="#ft28a"><span class="sp">28</span></a> and D. Gianotti.<a name="fa29a" id="fa29a" href="#ft29a"><span class="sp">29</span></a> The step&mdash;very important had it
been adopted consistently or with a view to consistency&mdash;of
substituting prose for verse as the diction of comedy, is sometimes
attributed to Ariosto; but, though his first two comedies
were originally written in prose, the experiment was not
new, nor did he persist in its adoption. Caretto&rsquo;s <i>I Sei Contenti</i>
dates from the end of the 15th century, and Publio Filippo&rsquo;s
<i>Formicone</i>, taken from Apuleius, followed quite early in the 16th.
Machiavelli, as will be seen, wrote comedies both in prose and
in verse.</p>

<p>But, whoever wrote the first Italian comedy, Ludovico
Ariosto was the first master of the species. All but the first two
of his comedies, belonging as they do to the field of <i>commedia
erudita</i>, or scholarly comedy, are in blank verse, to which he gave
a singular mobility by the dactylic ending of the line (<i>sdrucciolo</i>).
Ariosto&rsquo;s models were the masterpieces of the <i>palliata</i>, and his
morals those of his age, which emulated those of the worst days
of ancient Rome or Byzantium in looseness, and surpassed them
in effrontery. He chose his subjects accordingly; but his
dramatic genius displayed itself in the effective drawing of
character,<a name="fa30a" id="fa30a" href="#ft30a"><span class="sp">30</span></a> and more especially in the skilful management of
complicated intrigues.<a name="fa31a" id="fa31a" href="#ft31a"><span class="sp">31</span></a> Such, with an additional brilliancy of
wit and lasciviousness of tone, are likewise the characteristics
of Machiavelli&rsquo;s famous prose comedy, the <i>Mandragola</i> (<i>The
Magic Draught</i>);<a name="fa32a" id="fa32a" href="#ft32a"><span class="sp">32</span></a> and at the height of their success, of the plays
of P. Aretino,<a name="fa33a" id="fa33a" href="#ft33a"><span class="sp">33</span></a> especially the prose <i>Marescalco</i> (1526-1527)
whose name, it has been said, ought to be written in asterisks.
It may be added that the plays of Ariosto and his followers were
represented with magnificent scenery and settings. Other
dramatists of the 16th century were B. Accolti, whose <i>Virginia</i>
(prob. before 1513) treats the story from Boccaccio which
reappears in <i>All&rsquo;s Well that Ends Well</i>; G. Cecchi, F. d&rsquo;Ambra,
A. F. Grazzini, N. Secco or Secchi and L. Dolce&mdash;all writers of
romantic comedy of intrigue in verse or prose.</p>

<p>During the same century the &ldquo;pastoral drama&rdquo; flourished
in Italy. The origin of this peculiar species&mdash;which was the
bucolic idyll in a dramatic form, and which freely
lent itself to the introduction of both mythological
<span class="sidenote">The pastoral drama.</span>
and allegorical elements&mdash;was purely literary, and
arose directly out of the classical studies and tastes
of the Renaissance. It was very far removed from the genuine
peasant plays which flourished in Venetia and Tuscany early
in the 16th century. The earliest example of the artificial, but
in some of its productions exquisite, growth in question was the
renowned scholar A. Politian&rsquo;s <i>Orfeo</i> (1472), which begins like
an idyll and ends like a tragedy. Intended to be performed with
music&mdash;for the pastoral drama is the parent of the opera&mdash;this
beautiful work tells its story simply. N. da Correggio&rsquo;s (1450-1508)
<i>Cefalo</i>, or <i>Aurora</i>, and others followed, before in 1554 A.
Beccari produced, as totally new of its kind, his Arcadian pastoral
drama <i>Il Sagrifizio</i>, in which the comic element predominates.
But an epoch in the history of the species is marked by the
<i>Aminta</i> of Tasso (1573), in whose Arcadia is allegorically mirrored
the Ferrara court. Adorned by choral lyrics of great beauty, it
presents an allegorical treatment of a social and moral problem;
and since the conception of the characters, all of whom think
and speak of nothing but love, is artificial, the charm of the poem
lies not in the interest of its action, but in the passion and
sweetness of its sentiment. This work was the model of many
others, and the pastoral drama reached its height of popularity
in the famous <i>Pastor fido</i> (written before 1590) of G. B. Guarini,
which, while founded on a tragic love-story, introduces into its
complicated plot a comic element, partly with a satirical intention.
It is one of those exceptional works which, by circumstance
as well as by merit, have become the property of the world&rsquo;s
literature at large. Thus, both in Italian and in other literatures,
the pastoral drama became a distinct species, characterized, like
the great body of modern pastoral poetry in general, by a tendency
either towards the artificial or towards the burlesque. Its
artificiality affected the entire growth of Italian comedy, including
the <i>commedia dell&rsquo; arte</i>, and impressed itself in an intensified
form upon the opera. The foremost Italian masters of the last-named
species, so far as it can claim to be included in the poetic
drama, were A. Zeno (1668-1750) and P. Metastasio.</p>

<p>The comic dramatists of the 17th century are grouped as
followers of the classical and of the romantic school, G. B. della
Porta (<i>q.v.</i>) and G. A. Cicognini (whom Goldoni
describes as full of whining pathos and commonplace
<span class="sidenote">Comedy in the 17th and 18th centuries.</span>
drollery, but as still possessing a great power to
interest) being regarded as the leading representatives
of the former. But neither of these largely intermixed groups
of writers could, with all its fertility, prevail against the competition,
on the one hand of the musical drama, and on the other
of the popular farcical entertainments and those introduced in
imitation of Spanish examples. Italian comedy had fallen into
decay, when its reform was undertaken by the wonderful
<span class="sidenote">Goldoni.</span>
theatrical genius of C. Goldoni. One of the most
fertile and rapid of playwrights (of his 150 comedies
16 were written and acted in a single year), he at the same
time pursued definite aims as a dramatist. Disgusted with
the conventional buffoonery, and ashamed of the rampant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page506" id="page506"></a>506</span>
immorality of the Italian comic stage, he drew his characters
from real life, whether of his native city (Venice)<a name="fa34a" id="fa34a" href="#ft34a"><span class="sp">34</span></a> or of society
at large, and sought to enforce virtuous and pathetic sentiments
without neglecting the essential objects of his art. Happy and
various in his choice of themes, and dipping deep into a popular
life with which he had a genuine sympathy, he produced, besides
comedies of general human character,<a name="fa35a" id="fa35a" href="#ft35a"><span class="sp">35</span></a> plays on subjects drawn
from literary biography<a name="fa36a" id="fa36a" href="#ft36a"><span class="sp">36</span></a> or from fiction.<a name="fa37a" id="fa37a" href="#ft37a"><span class="sp">37</span></a> Goldoni, whose style
was considered defective by the purists whom Italy has at no
time lacked, met with a severe critic and a temporarily successful
<span class="sidenote">Gozzi.</span>
rival in Count C. Gozzi (1722-1806), who sought to
rescue the comic drama from its association with the
actual life of the middle classes, and to infuse a new spirit into
the figures of the old masked comedy by the invention of a new
species. His themes were taken from Neapolitan<a name="fa38a" id="fa38a" href="#ft38a"><span class="sp">38</span></a> and Oriental<a name="fa39a" id="fa39a" href="#ft39a"><span class="sp">39</span></a>
fairy tales, to which he accommodated some of the standing
figures upon which Goldoni had made war. This attempt at
mingling fancy and humour&mdash;occasionally of a directly satirical
turn<a name="fa40a" id="fa40a" href="#ft40a"><span class="sp">40</span></a>&mdash;was in harmony with the tendencies of the modern
romantic school; and Gozzi&rsquo;s efforts, which though successful
found hardly any imitators in Italy, have a family resemblance
to those of Tieck and of some more recent writers whose art
wings its flight, through the windows, &ldquo;over the hills and far
away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the latter part of the 18th and the early years of the
19th century comedy continued to follow the course marked
out by its acknowledged master Goldoni, under the
influence of the sentimental drama of France and other
<span class="sidenote">Comedians after Goldoni.</span>
countries. Abati Andrea Villi, the marquis Albergati
Capacelli, Antonio Simone Sografi (1760-1825),
Federici, and Pietro Napoli Signorelli (1731-1815), the historian
of the drama, are mentioned among the writers of this school;
to the 19th century belong Count Giraud, Marchisio (who took
his subjects especially from commercial life), and Nota, a fertile
writer, among whose plays are three treating the lives of poets.
Of still more recent date are L. B. Bon and A. Brofferio. At
the same time, the comedy of dialect to which the example of
Goldoni had given sanction in Venice, flourished there as well as
in the mutually remote spheres of Piedmont and Naples. Quite
modern developments must remain unnoticed here; but the
fact cannot be ignored that they signally illustrate the perennial
vitality of the modern drama in the home of its beginnings. A
new realistic style set fully in about the middle of the 18th
century with P. Ferrari and A. Torelli; and though an historical
reaction towards classical and medieval themes is associated with
the names of P. Cossa and G. Giacosa, modernism reasserted
itself through P. Bracco and other dramatists. It should be noted
that the influence of great actors, more especially Ermete
Novelli and Eleanora Duse, must be credited with a large share
of the success with which the Italian stage has held its own
even against the foreign influences to which it gave room. And
it would seem as if even the paradoxical endeavour of the poet
Gabrielle d&rsquo; Annunzio to lyricize the drama by ignoring action
as its essence were a problem for the solution of which the stage
can furnish unexpected conditions of its own. In any event,
both Italian tragedy and Italian comedy have survived periods
of a seemingly hopeless decline; and the fear has vanished
that either the opera or the ballet might succeed in ousting
from the national stage the legitimate forms of the national
drama.</p>

<p class="center pt2">(b) <i>Greece.</i></p>

<p>The dramatic literature of the later Hellenes is a creation
of the literary movement which preceded their noble struggle
for independence, or which may be said to form part
of that struggle. After beginning with dramatic
<span class="sidenote">Modern Greek and Dalmatian drama.</span>
dialogues of a patriotic tendency, it took a step in
advance with the tragedies of J. R. Nerulos<a name="fa41a" id="fa41a" href="#ft41a"><span class="sp">41</span></a> (1778-1850),
whose name belongs to the political as well as to the
literary history of his country. His comedies&mdash;especially one
directed against the excesses of journalism<a name="fa42a" id="fa42a" href="#ft42a"><span class="sp">42</span></a>&mdash;largely contributed
to open a literary life for the modern Greek tongue. Among
the earlier patriotic Greek dramatists of the 19th century are
T. Alkaeos, J. Zampelios (whose tragic style was influenced by
that of Alfieri),<a name="fa43a" id="fa43a" href="#ft43a"><span class="sp">43</span></a> S. K. Karydis and A. Valaoritis. A. Zoiros<a name="fa44a" id="fa44a" href="#ft44a"><span class="sp">44</span></a>
is noteworthy as having introduced the use of prose into Greek
tragedy, while preserving to it that association with sentiments
and aspirations which will probably long continue to pervade
the chief productions of modern Greek literature. The love of
the theatre is ineradicable from Attic as it is from Italian soil;
and the tendencies of the young dramatic literature of Hellas
which is not wholly absorbed in the effort to keep abreast of
recent modern developments, seem to justify the hope that a
worthy future awaits it.</p>

<p>Under Italian influence an interesting dramatic growth
attained to some vitality in the Dalmatian lands about the
beginning of the 16th century, where the religious drama, whose
days were passing away in Italy, found favour with a people
with a scant popular literature of its own. At Ragusa Italian
literary influence had been spread by the followers of Petrarch
from the later years of the 15th century; here several Servo-Croatian
writers produced religious plays in the manner of the
Italian <i>rappresentazioni</i>; and a gifted poet, Martin Dr&#382;i&#263;,
composed, besides religious plays and farces, a species of pastoral
which enjoyed much favour.</p>

<p class="center pt2">(c) <i>Spain.</i></p>

<p>Spain is the only country of modern Europe which shares with
England the honour of having achieved, at a relatively early date,
the creation of a genuinely national form of the regular drama.
So proper to Spain was the form of the drama which she
produced and perfected, that to it the term <i>romantic</i> has been
specifically applied, though so restricted a use of the epithet is
clearly unjustifiable. The influences which from the Romance
peoples&mdash;in whom Christian and Germanic elements mingled
with the legacy of Roman law, learning and culture&mdash;spread to
the Germanic nations were represented with the most signal
force and fulness in the institutions of chivalry,&mdash;to which, in the
words of Scott, &ldquo;it was peculiar to blend military valour with the
strongest passions which actuate the human mind, the feelings
of devotion and those of love.&rdquo; These feelings, in their combined
operation upon the national character, and in their reflection
in the national literature, were not confined to Spain; but
nowhere did they so long or so late continue to animate the moral
life of a nation.</p>

<p>Outward causes contributed to this result. For centuries
after the crusades had become a mere memory, Spain was a
battle-ground between the Cross and the Crescent. And it was
just at the time when the Renaissance was establishing new
starting-points for the literary progress of Europe, that Christian
Spain rose to the height of Catholic as well as national self-consciousness
by the expulsion of the Moors and the conquest
of the New World. From their rulers or rivals of so many
centuries the Spaniards derived that rich, if not very varied,
glow of colour which became permanently distinctive of their
national life, and more especially of its literary and artistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page507" id="page507"></a>507</span>
expressions; they also perhaps derived from the same source a
not less characteristically refined treatment of the passion of
love. The ideas of Spanish chivalry&mdash;more especially religious
devotion and a punctilious sense of personal honour&mdash;asserted
themselves (according to a process often observable in the history
of civilization) with peculiar distinctness in literature and art,
after the period of great achievements to which they had contributed
in other fields had come to an end. The ripest glories
of the Spanish drama belong to an age of national decay&mdash;mindful,
it is true, of the ideas of a greater past. The chivalrous
enthusiasm pervading so many of the masterpieces of its literature
is indeed a distinctive feature of the Spanish nation in all, even
in the least hopeful, periods of its later history; and the religious
ardour breathed by these works, though associating itself with
what is called the Catholic Reaction, is in truth only a manifestation
of the spirit which informed the noblest part of the Reformation
movement itself. The Spanish drama neither sought nor
could seek to emancipate itself from views and forms of religious
life more than ever sacred to the Spanish people since the glorious
days of Ferdinand and Isabella; and it is not so much in the
beginnings as in the great age of Spanish dramatic literature that
it seems most difficult to distinguish between what is to be
termed a religious and what a secular play. After Spain had thus,
the first after England among modern European countries, fully
unfolded that incomparably richest expression of national life
and sentiment in an artistic form&mdash;a truly national dramatic
literature,&mdash;the terrible decay of her greatness and prosperity
gradually impaired the strength of a brilliant but, of its nature,
dependent growth. In the absence of high original genius the
Spanish dramatists began to turn to foreign models, though
little supported in such attempts by popular sympathy; and it
is only in more recent times that the Spanish drama has sought
to reproduce the ancient forms from whose masterpieces the
nation had never become estranged, while accommodating them
to tastes and tendencies shared by later Spanish literature with
that of Europe at large.</p>

<p>The earlier dramatic efforts of Spanish literature may without
inconvenience be briefly dismissed. The reputed author of the
<i>Coplas de Mingo Revulgo</i> (R. Cota the elder) likewise
composed the first act of a story of intrigue and
<span class="sidenote">Early efforts.</span>
character, purely dramatic but not intended for representation.
This tragic comedy of <i>Calisto and Meliboea</i>, which
was completed (in 21 acts) by 1499, afterwards became famous
under the name of <i>Celestina</i>; it was frequently imitated and
translated, and was adapted for the Spanish stage by R. de
Zepeda in 1582. But the father of the Spanish drama was J. de
la Enzina, whose <i>representaciones</i> under the name of &ldquo;eclogues&rdquo;
were dramatic dialogues of a religious or pastoral character.
His attempts were imitated more especially by the Portuguese
<span class="sidenote">Gil Vicente.</span>
Gil Vicente, whose writings for the stage appear to be
included in the period 1502-1536, and who wrote both
in Spanish and in his native tongue. A further impulse
came, as was natural, from Spaniards resident in Italy, and
especially from B. de Torres Naharro, who in 1517 published, as
the chief among the &ldquo;firstlings of his genius&rdquo; (<i>Propaladia</i>), a
series of eight <i>comedias</i>&mdash;a term generally applied in Spanish
literature to any kind of drama. He claimed some knowledge of
the theory of the ancient drama, divided his plays into <i>jornadas</i><a name="fa45a" id="fa45a" href="#ft45a"><span class="sp">45</span></a>
(to correspond to acts), and opened them with an <i>introyto</i>
(prologue). Very various in their subjects, and occasionally odd
in form,<a name="fa46a" id="fa46a" href="#ft46a"><span class="sp">46</span></a> they were gross as well as audacious in tone, and were
soon prohibited by the Inquisition. The church remained unwilling
to renounce her control over such dramatic exhibitions
as she permitted, and sought to suppress the few plays on not
strictly religious subjects which appeared in the early part of
the reign of Charles I. Though the universities produced both
translations from the classical drama and modern Latin plays,
these exercised very little general effect. Juan Perez&rsquo; (Petreius&rsquo;)
posthumous Latin comedies were mainly versions of Ariosto.<a name="fa47a" id="fa47a" href="#ft47a"><span class="sp">47</span></a></p>

<p>Thus the foundation of the Spanish national theatre was
reserved for a man of the people. Cervantes has vividly sketched
the humble resources which were at the command of
Lope de Rueda, a mechanic of Seville, who with his
<span class="sidenote">Lope de Rueda and his followers.</span>
friend the bookseller Timoneda, and two brother
authors and actors in his strolling company, succeeded
in bringing dramatic entertainments out of the churches and
palaces into the public places of the towns, where they were
produced on temporary scaffolds. The manager carried about
his properties in a corn-sack; and the &ldquo;comedies&rdquo; were still
only &ldquo;dialogues, and a species of eclogues between two or three
shepherds and a shepherdess,&rdquo; enlivened at times by intermezzos
of favourite comic figures, such as the negress or the Biscayan,
&ldquo;played with inconceivable talent and truthfulness by Lope.&rdquo;
One of his plays at least,<a name="fa48a" id="fa48a" href="#ft48a"><span class="sp">48</span></a> and one of Timoneda&rsquo;s,<a name="fa49a" id="fa49a" href="#ft49a"><span class="sp">49</span></a> seem to have
been taken from an Italian source; others mingled modern
themes with classical apparitions,<a name="fa50a" id="fa50a" href="#ft50a"><span class="sp">50</span></a> one of Timoneda&rsquo;s was
(perhaps again through the Italian) from Plautus.<a name="fa51a" id="fa51a" href="#ft51a"><span class="sp">51</span></a> Others of a
slighter description were called <i>pasos</i>,&mdash;a species afterwards
termed <i>entremeses</i> and resembling the modern French <i>proverbes</i>.
With these popular efforts of Lope de Rueda and his friends a
considerable dramatic activity began in the years 1560-1590
in several Spanish cities, and before the close of this period
permanent theatres began to be fitted up at Madrid. Yet
Spanish dramatic literature might still have been led
<span class="sidenote">Classical dramas.</span>
to follow Italian into an imitation of classical models.
Two plays by G. Bermudez (1577), called by their
learned author &ldquo;the first Spanish tragedies,&rdquo; treating the national
subject of Inez de Castro, but divided into five acts, composed in
various metres, and introducing a chorus; a <i>Dido</i> (c. 1580) by
C. de Virues (who claimed to have first divided dramas into
three <i>jornadas</i>); and the tragedies of L. L. de Argensola (acted
1585, and praised in <i>Don Quixote</i>) alike represent this tendency.</p>

<p>Such were the alternatives which had opened for the Spanish
drama, when at last, about the same time as that of the English,
its future was determined by writers of original genius.
The first of these was the immortal Cervantes, who,
<span class="sidenote">Cervantes.</span>
however, failed to anticipate by his earlier plays (1584-1588) the
great (though to him unproductive) success of his famous
romance. In his endeavour to give a poetic character to the
drama he fell upon the expedient of introducing personified
abstractions speaking a &ldquo;divine&rdquo; or elevated language&mdash;a
device which was for a time favourably received. But these
plays exhibit a neglect or ignorance of the laws of dramatic
construction; their action is episodical; and it is from the
realism of these episodes (especially in the <i>Numancia</i>, which is
crowded with both figures and incidents), and from the power
and flow of the declamation, that their effect must have been
derived. When in his later years (1615) Cervantes returned to
dramatic composition, the style and form of the national drama
had been definitively settled by a large number of writers, the
brilliant success of whose acknowledged chief may previously
have diverted Cervantes from his labours for the theatre. His
influence upon the general progress of dramatic literature is,
however, to be sought, not only in his plays, but also in those
<i>novelas exemplares</i>&mdash;incomparable alike in their clearness and
their terseness of narrative&mdash;to which more than one drama is
indebted for its plot, and for much of its dialogue to boot.</p>

<p>Lope de Vega, one of the most astonishing geniuses the world
has known, permanently established the national forms of the
Spanish drama. Some of these were in their beginnings
taken over by him from ruder predecessors; some
<span class="sidenote">Lope de Vega.</span>
were cultivated with equal or even superior success by
subsequent authors; but in variety, as in fertility of dramatic
production, he has no rivals. His fertility, which was such that
he wrote about 1500 plays, besides 300 dramatic works classed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page508" id="page508"></a>508</span>
as <i>autos sacramentales</i> and <i>entremeses</i>, and a vast series of other
literary compositions, has indisputably prejudiced his reputation
with those to whom he is but a name and a number. Yet as a
dramatist Lope more fully exemplifies the capabilities of the
Spanish theatre than any of his successors, though as a poet
Calderon may deserve the palm. Nor would it be possible to
imagine a truer representative of the Spain of his age than a poet
who, after suffering the hardships of poverty and exile, and the
pangs of passion, sailed against the foes of the faith in the
Invincible Armada, subsequently became a member of the Holy
Inquisition and of the order of St Francis, and after having been
decorated by the pope with the cross of Malta and a theological
doctorate, honoured by the nobility, and idolized by the nation,
ended with the names of Jesus and Mary on his lips. From the
plays of such a writer we may best learn the manners and the
sentiments, the ideas of religion and honour, of the Spain of the
Philippine age, the age when she was most prominent in the eyes
of Europe and most glorious in her own. For, with all its
inventiveness and vigour, the genius of Lope primarily set itself
the task of pleasing his public,&mdash;the very spirit of whose inner as
well as outer life is accordingly mirrored in his dramatic works.
In them we have, in the words of Lope&rsquo;s French translator Baret,
&ldquo;the movement, the clamour, the conflict of unforeseen intrigues
suitable to unreflecting spectators; perpetual flatteries addressed
to an unextinguishable national pride; the painting of passions
dear to a people never tired of admiring itself; the absolute
sway of the point of honour; the deification of revenge; the
adoration of symbols; buffoonery and burlesque, everywhere
beloved of the multitude, but here never defiled by obscenities,
for this people has a sense of delicacy, and the foundation of its
character is nobility; lastly, the flow of proverbs which at
times escape from the <i>gracioso</i>&rdquo; (the comic servant domesticated
in the Spanish drama by Lope)&mdash;&ldquo;the commonplace literature
of those who possess no other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plays of Lope, and those of the national Spanish drama in
general, are divided into classes which it is naturally not always
easy, and which there is no reason to suppose him
always to have intended, to keep distinct from one
<span class="sidenote">Comedias de capa y espada.</span>
another. After in his early youth composing eclogues,
pastoral plays, and allegorical moralities in the old
style, he began his theatrical activity at Madrid about 1590,
and the plays which he thenceforth produced have been distributed
under the following heads. The <i>comedias</i>, all of which are
in verse, include (1) the so-called <i>c. de capa y espada</i>&mdash;not
comedies proper, but dramas in which the principal personages
are taken from the class of society that wears cloak and sword.
Gallantry is their main theme, an interesting and complicated,
but well-constructed and perspicuous intrigue their chief feature;
and this is usually accompanied by an underplot in which the
<i>gracioso</i> plays his part. Their titles are frequently taken from
the old proverbs or proverbial phrases of the people<a name="fa52a" id="fa52a" href="#ft52a"><span class="sp">52</span></a> upon
the theme suggested, by which the plays often (as G. H. Lewes
admirably expresses it) constitute a kind of gloss (<i>glosa</i>) in
action. This is the favourite species of the national Spanish
theatre; and to the plots of the plays belonging to it the drama
of other nations owes a debt almost incalculable in extent.
<span class="sidenote">Heróicas.</span>
(2) The <i>c. heróicas</i> are distinguished by some of their
personages being of royal or very high rank, and by
their themes being often historical and largely<a name="fa53a" id="fa53a" href="#ft53a"><span class="sp">53</span></a> (though not invariably<a name="fa54a" id="fa54a" href="#ft54a"><span class="sp">54</span></a>)
taken from the national annals, or founded on contemporary
or recent events.<a name="fa55a" id="fa55a" href="#ft55a"><span class="sp">55</span></a> Hence they exhibit a greater
gravity of tone; but in other respects there is no difference
between them and the cloak-and-sword comedies with which they
share the element of comic underplots. Occasionally Lope condescended
in the opposite direction, to (3) plays of which the scene
is laid in common life, but for which no special name appears
to have existed.<a name="fa56a" id="fa56a" href="#ft56a"><span class="sp">56</span></a> Meanwhile, both he and his successors were
too devoted sons of the church not to acknowledge in some sort
her claim to influence the national drama. This claim she had
never relinquished, even when she could no longer retain an
absolute control over the stage. For a time, indeed, she was
able to reassert even this; for the exhibition of all secular plays
was in 1598 prohibited by the dying Philip II., and remained so
for two years; and Lope with his usual facility proceeded to
supply religious plays of various kinds. After a few dramas on
scriptural subjects he turned to the legends of the saints; and
<span class="sidenote">Comedias de santos.</span>
the <i>comedias de santos</i>, of which he wrote a great
number, became an accepted later Spanish variety
of the miracle-play. True, however, to the popular
instincts of his genius, he threw himself with special zeal and
success into the composition of another kind of religious plays&mdash;a
development of the Corpus Christi pageants, in honour of
which all the theatres had to close their doors for a month.
<span class="sidenote">Autos sacramentales.</span>
These were the famous <i>autos sacramentales</i> (<i>i.e.</i> solemn
&ldquo;acts&rdquo; or proceedings in honour of the Sacrament),
which were performed in the open air by actors who
had filled the cars of the sacred procession. Of these
Lope wrote about 400. These entertainments were arranged
on a fixed scheme, comprising a prologue in dialogue between
two or more actors in character (<i>loa</i>), a farce (<i>entremes</i>), and the
<i>auto</i> proper, an allegorical scene of religious purport, as an
example of which Ticknor cites the <i>Bridge of the World</i>,&mdash;in
which the Prince of Darkness in vain seeks to defend the bridge
against the Knight of the Cross, who finally leads the Soul of
<span class="sidenote">Entremeses.</span>
Man in triumph across it. Not all the <i>entremeses</i> of
Lope and others were, however, composed for insertion
in these <i>autos</i>. This long-lived popular species,
together with the old kind of dramatic dialogue called <i>eclogues</i>,
completes the list of the varieties of his dramatic works.</p>

<p>The example of Lope was followed by a large number of
writers, and Spain thus rapidly became possessed of a dramatic
literature almost unparalleled in quantity&mdash;for in
fertility also Lope was but the first among many.
<span class="sidenote">The school of Lope.</span>
Among the writers of Lope&rsquo;s school, his friend G. de
Castro (1569-1631) must not be passed by, for his <i>Cid</i><a name="fa57a" id="fa57a" href="#ft57a"><span class="sp">57</span></a> was the
basis of Corneille&rsquo;s; nor J. P. de Montalban, &ldquo;the first-born of
Lope&rsquo;s genius,&rdquo; the extravagance of whose imagination, like
that of Lee, culminated in madness. Soon after him died (1639)
Juan Ruiz de Alarcon, in whose plays, as contrasted with those
of Lope, has been recognized the distinctive element of a moral
purpose. To G. Tellez, called Tirso de Molina (d. 1648), no
similar praise seems due; but the frivolous gaiety of the inventor
of the complete character of Don Juan was accompanied by
ingenuity in the construction of his excellent<a name="fa58a" id="fa58a" href="#ft58a"><span class="sp">58</span></a> though at times
&ldquo;sensational&rdquo;<a name="fa59a" id="fa59a" href="#ft59a"><span class="sp">59</span></a> plots. F. de Rojas Zorrilla (b. 1607), who was
largely plundered by the French dramatists of the latter half of
the century, survived Molina for about a generation. In vain
scholars of strictly classical tastes protested in essays in prose and
verse against the ascendancy of the popular drama; the prohibition
of Philip II. had been recalled two years after his death
and was never renewed; and the activity of the theatre spread
through the towns and villages of the land, everywhere under the
controlling influence of the school of writers who had established
so complete a harmony between the drama and the tastes and
tendencies of the people.</p>

<p>The glories of Spanish dramatic literature reached their height
in P. Calderon de la Barca, though in the history of the Spanish
theatre he holds only the second place. He elaborated
some of the forms of the national drama, but brought
<span class="sidenote">Calderon.</span>
about no changes of moment in any of them. Even the brilliancy
of his style, glittering with a constant reproduction of the same
family of tropes, and the variety of his melodious versification,
are mere intensifications of the poetic qualities of Lope, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>509</span>
in their moral and religious sentiments, and their general views
of history and society, there is no difference between the two.
Like Lope, Calderon was a soldier in his youth and an ecclesiastic
in his later years; like his senior, he suited himself to the tastes
of both court and people, and applied his genius with equal
facility to the treatment of religious and of secular themes.
In fertility Calderon was inferior to Lope (for he wrote not many
more than 100 plays); but he surpasses the elder poet in richness
of style, and more especially in fire of imagination. In his <i>autos</i>
(of which he is said to have left not less than 73), Calderon probably
attained to his most distinctive excellence; some of these
appear to take a wide range of allegorical invention,<a name="fa60a" id="fa60a" href="#ft60a"><span class="sp">60</span></a> while they
uniformly possess great beauty of poetical detail. Other of his
most famous or interesting pieces are <i>comedias de santos</i>.<a name="fa61a" id="fa61a" href="#ft61a"><span class="sp">61</span></a> In his
secular plays he treats as wide a variety of subjects as Lope,
but it is not a dissimilar variety; nor would it be easy to decide
whether a poet so uniformly admirable within his limits has
achieved greater success in romantic historical tragedy,<a name="fa62a" id="fa62a" href="#ft62a"><span class="sp">62</span></a> in the
comedy of amorous intrigue,<a name="fa63a" id="fa63a" href="#ft63a"><span class="sp">63</span></a> or in a dramatic work combining
fancy and artificiality in such a degree that it has been diversely
described as a romantic caprice and as a philosophical poem.<a name="fa64a" id="fa64a" href="#ft64a"><span class="sp">64</span></a></p>

<p>During the life of the second great master of the Spanish
drama there was little apparent abatement in the productivity
of its literature; while the <i>autos</i> continued to flourish
in Madrid and elsewhere, till in 1765 (shortly before
<span class="sidenote">Contemporaries of Calderon.</span>
the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain) their public
representation was prohibited by royal decree. In the
world of fashion, the opera had reached Spain already during
Calderon&rsquo;s lifetime, together with other French influences,
and the great dramatist had himself written one or two of his
plays for performance with music. But the regular national
<span class="sidenote">Moreto and the comedia de figuron.</span>
drama continued to command popular favour, and
with A. Moreto may be said to have actually taken a
step in advance. While he wrote in all the forms
established by Lope and cultivated by Calderon, his
manner seems most nearly to approach the masterpieces of
French and later English comedy of character; he was the earliest
writer of the <i>comedias de figuron</i>, in which the most prominent
personage is (in Congreve&rsquo;s phrase) &ldquo;a character of affectation,&rdquo;
in other words, the Spanish fop of real life.<a name="fa65a" id="fa65a" href="#ft65a"><span class="sp">65</span></a> His masterpiece,
a favourite of many stages, is one of the most graceful and
pleasing of modern comedies&mdash;simple but interesting in plot,
and true to nature, with something like Shakespearian truth.<a name="fa66a" id="fa66a" href="#ft66a"><span class="sp">66</span></a>
Other writers trod more closely in the footsteps of the masters
without effecting any noticeable changes in the form of the
Spanish drama; even the <i>saynete</i> (tit-bit), which owes its name
to Benavente (fl. 1645), was only a kind of <i>entremes</i>. The
Spanish drama in all its forms retained its command over the
nation, because they were alike popular in origin and character;
nor is there any other example of so complete an adaptation
of a national art to the national taste and sentiment in its ethics
and aesthetics, in the nature of the plots of the plays (whatever
their origin), in the motives of their actions, in the conduct and
tone and in the very costume of their characters.</p>

<p>National as it was, and because of this very quality, the Spanish
drama was fated to share the lot of the people it so fully represented.
At the end of the 17th century, when the
Spanish throne at last became the declared apple of
<span class="sidenote">Decay of the national Spanish drama.</span>
discord among the governments of Europe, the Spanish
people lay, in the words of an historian of its later days,
&ldquo;like a corpse, incapable of feeling its own impotence.&rdquo;
That national art to which it had so faithfully clung had fallen
into decline and decay with the spirit of Spain itself. By the
time of the close of the great war, the theatre had sunk into a
mere amusement of the populace, which during the greater part
of the 18th century, while allowing the old masters the measure of
favour which accords with traditional esteem, continued to uphold
the representatives of the old drama in its degeneracy&mdash;authors
on the level of their audiences. But the Spanish court was now
<span class="sidenote">The French school of the 18th century.</span>
French, and in the drama, even more than in any other
form of art, France was the arbiter of taste in Europe.
With the restoration of peace accordingly began isolated
attempts to impose the French canons of dramatic
theory, and to follow the example of French dramatic
practice; and in the middle of the century these endeavours
assumed more definite form. Montiano&rsquo;s bloodless tragedy of
<i>Virginia</i> (1750), which was never acted, was accompanied
by a discourse endeavouring to reconcile the doctrines of the
author with the practice of the old Spanish dramatists; the play
itself was in blank verse (a metre never used by Calderon, though
occasionally by Lope), instead of the old national ballad-measures
(the romance-measure with assonance and the rhymed <i>redondilla</i>
quatrain) preferred by the old masters among the variety of
metres employed by them. The earliest Spanish comedy in
the French form (a translation only, though written in the
national metre)<a name="fa67a" id="fa67a" href="#ft67a"><span class="sp">67</span></a> (1751), and the first original Spanish comedy
on the same model, Nicolas Moratin&rsquo;s <i>Petimetra</i> (<i>Petite-Maîtresse</i>),
printed in 1726 with a critical dissertation, likewise remained
unacted. In 1770, however, the same author&rsquo;s <i>Hormesinda</i>,
an historic drama on a national theme and in the national
metre, but adhering to the French rules, appeared on the stage;
and similar attempts followed in tragedy by the same writer
and others (including Ayala, who ventured in 1775 to compete
with Cervantes on the theme of Numantia), and in comedy by
Iriarte and Jovellanos (afterwards minister under Godoy), who
produced a sentimental comedy in Diderot&rsquo;s manner.<a name="fa68a" id="fa68a" href="#ft68a"><span class="sp">68</span></a> But
<span class="sidenote">Other later dramatists.</span>
these endeavours failed to effect any change in the
popular theatre, which was with more success raised
from its deepest degradation by R. de la Cruz, a fertile
author of light pieces of genuine humour, especially
<i>saynetes</i>, depicting the manners of the middle and lower classes.
In literary circles Garcia de la Huerta&rsquo;s voluminous collection
of the old plays (1785) gave a new impulse to dramatic productivity,
and the conflict continued between representatives
of the old school, such as Luciano Francisco Comella (1716-1779)
and of the new, such as the younger Moratin, whose comedies&mdash;of
which the last and most successful<a name="fa69a" id="fa69a" href="#ft69a"><span class="sp">69</span></a> was in prose&mdash;raised
him to the foremost position among the dramatists of his age.
In tragedy N. de Cienfuegos likewise showed some originality.
After, however, the troubles of the French domination and the
war had come to an end, the precepts and examples of the new
school failed to reassert themselves.</p>

<p>Already in 1815 an active critical controversy was carried on
by Böhl de Faber against the efforts of J. Faber and Alcalá
Galiano to uphold the principles of classicism; and with the aid
of the eminent actor Máiquez the old romantic masterpieces were
easily reinstated in the public favour, which as a matter of fact
they had never forfeited. The Spanish dramatists of the 19th
century, after passing, as in the instance of F. Martinez de la
Rosa and Bréton de los Herreros, from the system of French
comedy to the manner of the national drama, appear either to
have stood under the influence of the French romantic school,
or to have returned once more to the old Spanish models. Among
the former class A. Gil y Zarate, of the latter J. Zorrilla, are
mentioned as specially prominent. The most renowned Spanish
dramatist at the opening of the 20th century was the veteran
politician and man of letters J. Echegaray.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the old religious performances are not wholly
extinct in Spain, and the relics of the solemn pageantry with
which they were associated may long continue to survive there,
as in the case of the <i>pasos</i>, which claim to have been exhibited
in Holy Week at Seville for at least three centuries. As to the
theatre itself, there can be no fear either that the imitation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page510" id="page510"></a>510</span>
of foreign examples will satisfy Spanish dramatists&mdash;especially
when, like the author of <i>Doña Perfecta</i> (Perez Galdos), they have
excellent home material of their own for adaptation,&mdash;or that the
Spanish public itself, with fine actors and actresses still upholding
the lofty traditions of the national drama, will remain too
fatigued to consume the drama unless bit by bit&mdash;in the shape
of <i>zarzuelas</i> and similar one-act confections. Whatever may be
the future of one of the noblest of modern dramatic literatures,
it may confidently be predicted that, so long as Spain is Spain, her
theatre will not be permanently either denationalized or degraded.</p>

<p class="center pt2">(d) <i>Portugal.</i></p>

<p>The Portuguese drama in its earlier phases, especially before
in the latter part of the 14th century the nation completely
achieved its independence, seems to have followed
much the same course as the Spanish; and the religious
<span class="sidenote">The Portuguese drama.</span>
drama in all its prevailing forms and direct
outgrowths retained its popularity even by the side
of the products of the Renaissance. In the later period of that
movement translations of classical dramas into the vernacular
were stimulated by the cosmopolitan example of George
Buchanan, who for a time held a post in the university of Coimbra;
to this class of play Teive&rsquo;s <i>Johannes</i> (1553) may be supposed
to have belonged. In the next generation Antonio Ferreira<a name="fa70a" id="fa70a" href="#ft70a"><span class="sp">70</span></a>
and others still wrote comedies more or less on the classical
model. But the rather vague title of &ldquo;the Plautus of Portugal&rdquo;
is accorded to an earlier comic writer, the celebrated Gil Vicente,
who died about 1536, after, it is stated, producing forty-two plays.
He was the founder of popular Portuguese comedy, and his
plays were called <i>autos</i>, or by the common name of <i>praticas</i>.<a name="fa71a" id="fa71a" href="#ft71a"><span class="sp">71</span></a>
Among his most gifted successors are mentioned A. Ribeiro,
called <i>Chiado</i> (the mocking-bird), who died in 1590;<a name="fa72a" id="fa72a" href="#ft72a"><span class="sp">72</span></a> his brother
Jeronymo, B. Dias, A. Pires, J. Pinto, H. Lopes and others.
The dramatic efforts of the illustrious poet Luis de Camões
(Camoens) are relatively of slight importance; they consist
of one of the many modern versions of the <i>Amphitruo</i>, and of two
other comedies, of which the earlier (<i>Filodemo</i>) was acted at
Goa in 1553, the subjects having a romantic colour.<a name="fa73a" id="fa73a" href="#ft73a"><span class="sp">73</span></a> Of greater
importance were the contributions to dramatic literature of
F. de Sá de Miranda, who, being well acquainted with both
Spanish and Italian life, sought early in his career to domesticate
the Italian comedy of intrigue on the Portuguese stage;<a name="fa74a" id="fa74a" href="#ft74a"><span class="sp">74</span></a> but
he failed to carry with him the public taste, which preferred
the <i>autos</i> of Gil Vicente. The followers of Miranda were, however,
more successful than he had been himself, among them the
already-mentioned Antonio Ferreira; the prose plays of Jorge
Ferreira de Vasconcellos, which bear some resemblance to the
Spanish <i>Celestina</i>, are valuable as pictures of contemporary
manners in city and court.<a name="fa75a" id="fa75a" href="#ft75a"><span class="sp">75</span></a></p>

<p>The later Portuguese dramatic literature seems also to have
passed through phases corresponding to those of the Spanish,
though with special features of its own. In the 18th century
Alcino Mycenio (1728-1770), known as Domingos dos Reis Quito
in everyday life, in which his avocation was that of Allan Ramsay,
was remarkably successful with a series of plays,<a name="fa76a" id="fa76a" href="#ft76a"><span class="sp">76</span></a> including of
course an <i>Inez de Castro</i>, which in a subsequent adaptation by
J. B. Gomes long held the national stage. Another dramatist,
of both merit and higher aspirations, was Lycidas Cynthio (<i>alias</i>
Manoel de Figueiredo, 1725-1801).<a name="fa77a" id="fa77a" href="#ft77a"><span class="sp">77</span></a> But the romantic movement
was very late in coming to Portugal. Curiously enough, one of
its chief representatives, the viscount da Almeida Garrett,
exhibited his sympathy with French, revolutionary and anti-English
ideas by a tragedy on the subject of Cato;<a name="fa78a" id="fa78a" href="#ft78a"><span class="sp">78</span></a> but his
later works were mainly on national subjects.<a name="fa79a" id="fa79a" href="#ft79a"><span class="sp">79</span></a> The expansive
tendencies of later Portuguese dramatic literature are illustrated
by the translations of A. F. de Castilho, who even ventured
upon Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i> (1872). Among 19th-century dramatists
are to be noted Pereira da Cunha, R. Cordeiro, E. Biester,
L. Palmeirin, and Garrett&rsquo;s disciple F. G. de Amorim, by
whom both political and social themes have been freely
treated. The reaction against romanticism observable in
Portuguese poetic literature can hardly fail to affect (or perhaps
has already affected) the growth of the national drama; for the
receptive qualities of both are not less striking than the productive.</p>

<p class="center pt2">(e) <i>France.</i></p>

<p>France was the only country, besides Italy, in which classical
tragedy was naturalized. In 1531 the Benedictine Barthélemy
of Loches printed a <i>Christus Xylonicus</i>; and a very
notable impulse was given both to the translation and
<span class="sidenote">The French regular drama.</span>
to the imitation of ancient models by a series of efforts
made in the university of Paris and other French
places of learning. The most successful of these attempts was
the <i>Johannes Baptistes</i> of George Buchanan, who taught in
Paris for five years and at a rather later date resided at Bordeaux,
where in 1540 he composed this celebrated tragedy (afterwards
translated into four or five modern languages), in which it is
now ascertained that he had in view the trial and condemnation
of Sir Thomas More. He also wrote <i>Jephthah</i>, and translated
into Latin the <i>Medea</i> and <i>Alcestis</i> of Euripides. At a rather
later date the great scholar M. A. Muret (Muretus) produced his
<i>Julius Caesar</i>, a work perhaps superior in correctness to
Buchanan&rsquo;s tragic masterpiece, but inferior to it in likeness to
life. About the same time the enthusiasm of the Paris classicists
showed itself in several translations of Sophoclean and Euripidean
tragedies into French verse.<a name="fa80a" id="fa80a" href="#ft80a"><span class="sp">80</span></a></p>

<p>Thus the beginnings of the regular drama in France, which,
without absolutely determining, potently swayed its entire
course, came to connect themselves directly with the great
literary movement of the Renaissance. Du Bellay sounded the
note of attack which converted that movement in France into
an endeavour to transform the national literature; and in
Ronsard the classical school of poetry put forward its conquering
hero and sovereign lawgiver. Among the disciples who gathered
<span class="sidenote">Jodelle.</span>
round Ronsard, and with him formed the &ldquo;Pleiad&rdquo;
of French literature, Étienne Jodelle, the reformer of
the French theatre, soon held a distinguished place. The stage
of this period left ample room for the enterprise of this youthful
writer. The popularity of the old entertainments had reached
its height when Louis XII., in his conflict with Pope Julius II.,
had not scrupled to call in the aid of Pierre Gringoire (Gringon),
and when the <i>Mère sotte</i> had mockingly masqueraded in the
petticoats of Holy Church. In the reign of Francis I. the
Inquisition, and on occasion the king himself, had to some extent
succeeded in repressing the audacity of the actors, whose follies
were at the same time an utter abomination in the eyes of the
Huguenots. For a time the very mysteries of the Brethren of
the Passion had been prohibited; while the moralities and
farces had sunk to an almost contemptible level. Yet to this
reign belong the contributions to farce-literature of three writers
so distinguished as Rabelais (non-extant), Clément Marot and
Queen Margaret of Navarre. Meanwhile isolated translations
of Italian<a name="fa81a" id="fa81a" href="#ft81a"><span class="sp">81</span></a> as well as classical dramas had in literature begun
the movement which Jodelle now transferred to the stage itself.
His tragedy <i>Cléopatre captive</i> was produced there on the same
day as his comedy <i>L&rsquo;Eugène</i>, in 1552, his <i>Didon se sacrifiant</i>
following in 1558. Thus at a time when a national theatre was
perhaps impossible in a country distracted by civil and religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page511" id="page511"></a>511</span>
conflicts, whose monarchy had not yet welded together a number
of provinces attached each to its own traditions, and whose
population, especially in the capital, was enervated by frivolity
or enslaved by fanaticism, was born that long-lived artificial
growth, the so-called classical tragedy of France. For French
comedy, though subjected to the same influences as tragedy,
had a national basis upon which to proceed, and its history is
partly that of a modification of old popular forms.</p>

<p>The history of French tragedy begins with the <i>Cléopâtre
captive</i>, in the representation of which the author, together
with other members of the &ldquo;Pleiad,&rdquo; took part. It is
a tragedy in the manner of Seneca, devoid of action
<span class="sidenote">French tragedy in the 16th century.</span>
and provided with a ghost and a chorus. Though
mainly written in the five-foot Iambic couplet, it
already contains passages in the Alexandrine metre, which soon
afterwards J. de La Péruse by his <i>Médée</i> (pr. 1556) established
in French tragedy, and which Jodelle employed in his <i>Didon</i>.
Numerous tragedies followed in the same style by various authors,
among whom Gabriel Bounyn produced the first French regular
tragedy on a subject neither Greek nor Roman,<a name="fa82a" id="fa82a" href="#ft82a"><span class="sp">82</span></a> and the brothers
de la Taille,<a name="fa83a" id="fa83a" href="#ft83a"><span class="sp">83</span></a> and J. Grévin,<a name="fa84a" id="fa84a" href="#ft84a"><span class="sp">84</span></a> distinguished themselves by their
style. In the reign of Charles IX. a vain attempt was made by
Nicolas Filleul to introduce the pastoral style of the Italians into
French tragedy;<a name="fa85a" id="fa85a" href="#ft85a"><span class="sp">85</span></a> and the Brotherhood of the Passion was
intermingling with pastoral plays its still continued reproductions
of the old entertainments, and the religious drama making its
expiring efforts, among which T. Le Coq&rsquo;s interesting mystery
of <i>Cain</i> (1580) should be noted. Beza&rsquo;s <i>Abraham sacrifiant</i>
(1550), J. de Coignac&rsquo;s <i>Goliath</i> (dedicated to Edward VI.),
Rivandeau&rsquo;s <i>Haman</i> (1561), belong to a group of Biblical tragedies,
inspired by Calvinist influences. But these more and
more approached to the examples of the classical school, which,
in spite of all difficulties and rivalries, prevailed. Among its
followers Montchrétien exhibited unusual vigour of rhetoric,<a name="fa86a" id="fa86a" href="#ft86a"><span class="sp">86</span></a>
and in R. Garnier French tragedy reached the greatest height
in nobility and dignity of style, as well as in the exhibition of
dramatic passion, to which it attained before Corneille. In his
tragedies<a name="fa87a" id="fa87a" href="#ft87a"><span class="sp">87</span></a> choruses are still interspersed among the long Alexandrine
tirades of the dialogue.</p>

<p>During this period comedy had likewise been influenced by
classical models; but the distance was less between the national
farces and Terence, than between the mysteries and
moralities, and Seneca and the Greeks. <i>L&rsquo;Eugène</i>
<span class="sidenote">Comedy under Italian influence.</span>
differs little in style from the more elaborate of the old
farces; and while it satirizes the foibles of the clergy
without any appreciable abatement of the old licence, its theme
is the favourite burden of the French comic theatre in all times&mdash;<i>le
cocuage</i>. The examples, however, which directly facilitated
the productivity of the French comic dramatists of this period,
among whom Jean de la Taille was the first to attempt a regular
comedy in prose,<a name="fa88a" id="fa88a" href="#ft88a"><span class="sp">88</span></a> were those of the Italian stage, which in 1576
established a permanent colony in France, destined to survive
there till the close of the 17th century, by which time it had
adopted the French language, and was ready to coalesce with
French actors, without, however, relinquishing all remembrance
of its origin. R. Belleau, a member of the &ldquo;Pleiad,&rdquo; produced
a comedy in which the type (already approached by Jodelle)
of the swaggering captain appears,<a name="fa89a" id="fa89a" href="#ft89a"><span class="sp">89</span></a> J. Grévin copied Italian
intrigue, characters and manners;<a name="fa90a" id="fa90a" href="#ft90a"><span class="sp">90</span></a> O. de Turnèbe (d. 1581)
borrowed the title of one Italian play<a name="fa91a" id="fa91a" href="#ft91a"><span class="sp">91</span></a> and perhaps parts of the
plots of others; the Florentine F. d&rsquo;Amboise (d. 1558) produced
versions of two Italian comedies;<a name="fa92a" id="fa92a" href="#ft92a"><span class="sp">92</span></a> and the foremost French
comic poet of the century, P. de Larivey, likewise an Italian
born (of the name of Pietro Giunto), openly professed to imitate
the poets of his native country. His plays are more or less literal
translations of L. Dolce,<a name="fa93a" id="fa93a" href="#ft93a"><span class="sp">93</span></a> Secchi<a name="fa94a" id="fa94a" href="#ft94a"><span class="sp">94</span></a> and other Italian dramatists;
and this lively and witty author, to whom Molière owes much,
thus connects two of the most important and successful growths
of the modern comic drama.</p>

<p>The close conjunction between the history of a living dramatic
literature and that of the theatre can least of all be ignored in the
case of France, where the actor&rsquo;s art has gone through so ample
an evolution, and where the theatre has so long and continuously
formed an important part of the national life. By the middle
of the 16th century not only had theatrical representations, now
quite emancipated from clerical control, here and there already
become matters of speculation and business, but the acting
profession was beginning to organize itself as such; strolling
companies of actors had become a more or less frequent experience;
and the attitude of the church and of civic respectability
were once more coming to be systematically hostile to
the stage and its representatives.</p>

<p>Before, however, either tragedy or comedy in France entered
into the period of their history when genius was to illuminate
both of them with creations of undying merit, and
before the theatre had associated itself enduringly
<span class="sidenote">French tragedy and comedy in the 17th century before Corneille.</span>
with the artistic and literary divisions of court and
society and the people at large, the country had passed
through a new phase of the national life. When the
troubles and terrors of the great civil and religious
wars of the 16th century were over at last, they were
found to have produced a reaction towards culture and
refinement which spread from certain spheres of society whose
influence was for a time prevailing. The seal had been set upon
the results of the Renaissance by Malherbe, the father of French
style. The masses meanwhile continued to solace or distract
their weariness and their sufferings with the help of the accredited
ministers of that half-cynical gaiety which has always lighted
up the darkest hours of French popular life. In the troublous
days preceding Richelieu&rsquo;s definitive accession to power (1624),
the <i>tabarinades</i>&mdash;a kind of street dialogue recalling the earliest
days of the popular drama&mdash;had made the Pont-Neuf the
favourite theatre of the Parisian populace. Meanwhile the
influence of Spain, which Henry IV. had overcome in politics,
had throughout his reign and afterwards been predominant in
other spheres, and not the least in that of literature. The <i>stilo
culto</i>, of which Gongora was the native Spanish, Marino the
Italian, and Lyly the English representative, asserted its dominion
over the favourite authors of French society; the pastoral
romance of Honoré d&rsquo;Urfé&mdash;the text-book of pseudo-pastoral
gallantry&mdash;was the parent of the romances of the Scudérys, de
La Calprenède and Mme de La Fayette; the Hôtel de Rambouillet
was in its glory; the true (not the false) <i>précieuses</i> sat
on the heights of intellectual society; and J. L. G. de Balzac
(ridiculed in the earliest French dramatic parody)<a name="fa95a" id="fa95a" href="#ft95a"><span class="sp">95</span></a> and Voiture
were the dictators of its literature. Much of the French drama
of this age is of the same kind as its romance-literature, like
which it fell under the polite castigation of Boileau&rsquo;s satire.
Heroic love (quite a technical passion), &ldquo;fertile in tender sentiments,&rdquo;
seized hold of the theatre as well as of the romances;
and La Calprenède, G. de Scudéry<a name="fa96a" id="fa96a" href="#ft96a"><span class="sp">96</span></a> and his sister and others
were equally fashionable in both species. The Gascon Cyrano de
Bergerac, though not altogether insignificant as a dramatist,<a name="fa97a" id="fa97a" href="#ft97a"><span class="sp">97</span></a>
gained his chief literary reputation by a Rabelaisian fiction.
Meanwhile, Spanish and Italian models continued to influence
both branches of the drama. Everybody knew by heart Gongora&rsquo;s
version of the story of &ldquo;young Pyramus and his love Thisbe,&rdquo;
as dramatized by Th. Viaud (1590-1626); and the sentiment of
Tristan<a name="fa98a" id="fa98a" href="#ft98a"><span class="sp">98</span></a> (1601-1655) overpowered Herod on the stage, and
drew tears from Cardinal Richelieu in the audience. J. Mairet
was noted for superior vigour.<a name="fa99a" id="fa99a" href="#ft99a"><span class="sp">99</span></a> P. Du Ryer&rsquo;s style is described
as, while otherwise superior to that of his contemporaries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page512" id="page512"></a>512</span>
Italian in its defects. A mixture of the forms of classical
comedy with elements of Spanish and of the Italian pastoral was
attempted with great temporary success by A. Hardy, a playwright
who thanked Heaven that he knew the precepts of his
art while preferring to follow the demands of his trade. The
mixture of styles begun by him was carried on by the marquis de
Racan,<a name="fa100a" id="fa100a" href="#ft100a"><span class="sp">100</span></a> J. de Rotrou and others; and among these comedies of
intrigue in the Spanish manner the earliest efforts of Corneille
himself<a name="fa101a" id="fa101a" href="#ft101a"><span class="sp">101</span></a> are to be classed. Rotrou&rsquo;s noteworthier productions<a name="fa102a" id="fa102a" href="#ft102a"><span class="sp">102</span></a>
are later in date than the event which marks an epoch in the
history of the French drama, the appearance of Corneille&rsquo;s
<i>Cid</i> (1636).</p>

<p>P. Corneille is justly revered as the first, and in some respects
the unequalled, great master of French tragedy, whatever may
have been unsound in his theories, or defective in his
practice. The attempts of his predecessors had been
<span class="sidenote">Corneille.</span>
without life, because they lacked really tragic characters and the
play of really tragic passions; while their style had been either
pedantically imitative or a medley of plagiarisms. He conquered
tragedy at once for the national theatre and for the national
literature&mdash;and this, not by a long tentative process of production,
but by a few masterpieces, which may be held to be
comprehended within the ten years 1636 to 1646; for in his
many later tragedies he never again proved fully equal to himself.
The French tragedy, of which the great age begins with the <i>Cid</i>,
<i>Horace</i>, <i>Cinna</i>, <i>Polyeucte</i> and <i>Rodogune</i>, was not, whatever it
professed to be, a copy of the classical tragedy of Greeks or
Romans, or an imitation of the Italian imitations of these; nor,
though in his later tragedies Corneille depended less and less
upon characters, and more and more, after the fashion of the
Spaniards, upon situations, and even upon spectacle, were
the forms of the Spanish drama able to assert their dominion
over the French tragic stage. The mould of French tragedy
was cast by Corneille; but the creative power of his genius was
unable to fill it with more than a few examples. His range of
passions and characters was limited; he preferred, he said, the
reproach of having made his women too heroic to that of having
made his men effeminate. His actions inclined too much to
the exhibition of conflicts political rather than broadly ethical
in their significance. The defects of his style are of less moment;
but in this, as in other respects, he was, with all his strength
and brilliancy, not one of those rarest of artists who are at the
same time the example and the despair of their successors.
The <i>examens</i> which he printed of all his plays up to 1660 show
how much self-criticism (though it may not always be as in this
case conscious) contributes to the true fertility of genius.</p>

<p>In comedy also Corneille begins the first great original epoch
of French dramatic literature; for it was to him that Molière
owed the inspiration of the tone and style which he made those
of the higher forms of French comedy. But <i>Le Menteur</i> (the
parent, with its sequel, of a numerous dramatic progeny<a name="fa103a" id="fa103a" href="#ft103a"><span class="sp">103</span></a>) was
itself derived from a Spanish original,<a name="fa104a" id="fa104a" href="#ft104a"><span class="sp">104</span></a> which it did not (as was
the case with the <i>Cid</i>) transform into something new. French
tragi-comedy Corneille can hardly be said to have invented;<a name="fa105a" id="fa105a" href="#ft105a"><span class="sp">105</span></a>
and of the mongrel growths of sentimental comedy and of
domestic drama or <i>drame</i>, he rather suggested than exemplified
the conditions.</p>

<p>The tragic art of Racine supplements rather than surpasses
that of his older contemporary. His works reflect the serene
and settled formality of an age in which the sun of
monarchy shone with an effulgence no clouds seemed
<span class="sidenote">Racine.</span>
capable of obscuring, and in which the life of a nation seemed
reducible to the surroundings of a court. The tone of the poetic
literature of such an age is not necessarily unreal, because the
range of its ideas is limited, and because its forms seem to exist
by an immutable authority. That Racine should permanently
hold the position which belongs to him in French dramatic
literature is due to the fact that to him it was given to present
these forms&mdash;the forms approved by his age&mdash;in what may
reasonably be called perfection; and, from the point of view
of workmanship, Sophocles could not have achieved more.
What his plays contain is another question. They suit themselves
so well to the successive phases in the life of Louis XIV.,
that Madame de Sévigné described Racine as having in his later
years loved God as he had formerly loved his mistresses; and
this sally at all events indicates the range of passions which
inspired his tragic muse. His heroes are all of one type&mdash;that
of a gracious gloriousness; his heroines vary in their fortunes,
but they are all the &ldquo;trophies of love,&rdquo;<a name="fa106a" id="fa106a" href="#ft106a"><span class="sp">106</span></a> with the exception
of the scriptural figures, which stand apart from the rest.<a name="fa107a" id="fa107a" href="#ft107a"><span class="sp">107</span></a>
T. Corneille, Campistron, Joseph Duché (1668-1704), Antoin de
Lafosse (c. 1653-1708) and Quinault were mere followers of one
or both of the great masters of tragedy, though the last named
achieved a reputation of his own in the bastard species of the
opera.</p>

<p>The type of French tragedy thus established, like everything
else which formed part of the &ldquo;age of Louis XIV.,&rdquo; proclaimed
itself as the definitively settled model of its kind, and
was accepted as such by a submissive world. Proud
<span class="sidenote">Characteristics of French classical tragedy.</span>
of its self-imposed fetters, French tragedy dictatorially
denied the liberty of which it had deprived itself to the
art of which it claimed to furnish the highest examples.
Yet, though calling itself classical, it had not caught the essential
spirit of the tragedy of the Greeks. The elevation of tone which
characterizes the serious drama of the age of Louis XIV. is a true
elevation, but its heights do not lose themselves in a sphere
peopled by the myths of a national religion, still less in the region
of great thoughts which ask Heaven to stoop to the aspirations
and the failures of man. The personages of this drama are
conventional like its themes, but the convention is with itself
only; Orestes and Iphigenia have not brought with them the
cries of the stern goddesses and the flame on the altar of Artemis;
their passions like their speech are cadenced by a modern measure.
In construction, the simplicity and regularity of the ancient
models are stereotyped into a rigid etiquette by the exigencies
of the court-theatre, which is but an apartment of the palace.
The unities of time and place, with the Greeks mere rules of
convenience, French tragedy imposes upon itself as a permanent
yoke. The Euripidean prologue is judiciously exchanged for
the exposition of the first act, and the lyrical element essential
to Greek tragedy is easily suppressed in its would-be copy;
lyrical passages still occur in some of Corneille&rsquo;s early masterpieces,<a name="fa108a" id="fa108a" href="#ft108a"><span class="sp">108</span></a>
but the chorus is consistently banished, to reappear only
in Racine&rsquo;s latest works<a name="fa109a" id="fa109a" href="#ft109a"><span class="sp">109</span></a> as a scholastic experiment appropriate
to a conventual atmosphere. Its uses for explanation and
comment are served by the expedient, which in its turn becomes
conventional, of the conversations with <i>confidants</i> and <i>confidantes</i>,
which more than sufficiently supply the foil of general sentiments.
The epical element is allowed full play in narrative passages,
more especially in those which relate parts of the catastrophe,<a name="fa110a" id="fa110a" href="#ft110a"><span class="sp">110</span></a>
and, while preserving the stage intact from realisms, suit themselves
to the generally rhetorical character of this species of the
tragic drama. This character impressed itself more and more
upon the tragic art of a rhetorical nation in an age when the
loftiest themes were in the pulpit receiving the most artistic
oratorical treatment, and developed in the style of French
classical tragedy the qualities which cause it to become something
between prose and poetry&mdash;or to appear (in the phrase of
a French critic) like prose in full dress. The force of this description
is borne out by the fact that the distinction between the
versification of French tragedy and that of French comedy seems
at times imperceptible.</p>

<p>The universal genius of Voltaire found it necessary to shine
in all branches of literature, and in tragedy to surpass predecessors
whom his own authority declared to have surpassed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page513" id="page513"></a>513</span>
the efforts of the Attic muse. He succeeded in impressing the
world with the belief that his innovations had imparted a fresh
<span class="sidenote">Voltaire.</span>
vitality to French tragedy; in truth, however, they
represent no essential advance in art, but rather
augmented the rhetorical tendency which paralyses true dramatic
life. Such life as his plays possess lies in their political and social
sentiments, their invective against tyranny,<a name="fa111a" id="fa111a" href="#ft111a"><span class="sp">111</span></a> and their exposure
of fanaticism.<a name="fa112a" id="fa112a" href="#ft112a"><span class="sp">112</span></a> In other respects his versatility was barren of
enduring results. He might take his themes from French history,<a name="fa113a" id="fa113a" href="#ft113a"><span class="sp">113</span></a>
or from Chinese,<a name="fa114a" id="fa114a" href="#ft114a"><span class="sp">114</span></a> or Egyptian,<a name="fa115a" id="fa115a" href="#ft115a"><span class="sp">115</span></a> or Syrian,<a name="fa116a" id="fa116a" href="#ft116a"><span class="sp">116</span></a> from the days of the
Epigoni<a name="fa117a" id="fa117a" href="#ft117a"><span class="sp">117</span></a> or from those of the Crusades;<a name="fa118a" id="fa118a" href="#ft118a"><span class="sp">118</span></a> he might appreciate
Shakespeare, with a more or less partial comprehension of his
strength, and condescendingly borrow from and improve the
barbarian.<a name="fa119a" id="fa119a" href="#ft119a"><span class="sp">119</span></a> But he added nothing to French tragedy where it
was weakest&mdash;in character; and where it was strongest&mdash;in
diction&mdash;he never equalled Corneille in fire or Racine in refinement.
While the criticism to which French tragedy in this age
at last began to be subjected has left unimpaired the real titles
to immortality of its great masters, the French theatre itself has
all but buried in respectful oblivion the dramatic works bearing
the name of Voltaire&mdash;a name persistently belittled, but
second to none in the history of modern progress and of modern
civilization.</p>

<p>As it is of relatively little interest to note the ramifications of
an art in its decline, the contrasts need not be pursued among
the contemporaries of Voltaire, between his imitator
Bernard Joseph Saurin (1706-1781), Saurin&rsquo;s royalist
<span class="sidenote">French classical tragedy in its decline.</span>
rival de Belloy, Racine&rsquo;s imitator Lagrange-Chancel
and Voltaire&rsquo;s own would-be rival, the &ldquo;terrible&rdquo;
Crébillon the elder, who professed to vindicate to
French tragedy, already mistress of the heavens through Corneille,
and of the earth through Racine, Pluto&rsquo;s supplementary realm,
but who, though thus essaying to carry tragedy lower, failed
to carry it farther. In the latter part of the 18th century French
classical tragedy as a literary growth was dying a slow death,
however numerous might be the leaves which sprouted from the
decaying tree. Its form had been permanently fixed; and even
Shakespeare, as manipulated by Ducis<a name="fa120a" id="fa120a" href="#ft120a"><span class="sp">120</span></a>&mdash;an author whose
tastes were better than his times&mdash;failed to bring about a change.
&ldquo;It is a Moor, not a Frenchman, who has written this play,&rdquo;
cried a spectator of Ducis&rsquo; <i>Othello</i> (1791); but Talma&rsquo;s conviction
was almost as strong as his capacity was great for convincing
his public; and he certainly did much to prepare the influence
which Shakespeare was gradually to assert over the French
drama, and which was aided by translations, more especially
that of Pierre Letourneur (1736-1788), which had attracted the
sympathy of Diderot and the execrations of the aged Voltaire.<a name="fa121a" id="fa121a" href="#ft121a"><span class="sp">121</span></a>
Meanwhile, the command which classical French tragedy continued
to assert over the stage was due in part, no doubt, to the
love of Roman drapery&mdash;not always abundant, but always in
the grand style&mdash;which characterized the Revolution, and which
was by the Revolution handed down to the Empire. It was
likewise, and more signally, due to the great actors who freed
the tragic stage from much of its artificiality and animated it
by their genius. No great artist has ever more generously
estimated the labours of a predecessor than Talma judged those
of Le Kain; but it was Talma himself whose genius was pre-eminently
fitted to reproduce the great figures of antiquity in
the mimic world, which, like the world outside, both required
and possessed its Caesar. He, like Rachel after him, reconciled
French classical tragedy with nature; and it is upon the art of
great original actors such as these that the theatrical future of
this form of the drama in France depends. Mere whims of fashion&mdash;even
when inspired by political feeling&mdash;will not waft back
to it a real popularity; nor will occasional literary aftergrowths,
however meritorious, such as the admirable <i>Lucrèce</i> of F. Ponsard
and the attempts of even more recent writers, suffice to re-establish
a living union between it and the progress of the
national literature.</p>

<p>The rival influences under which classical tragedy has after
a long struggle virtually become a thing of the past in French
literature are also to be traced in the history of French
comedy, which under the co-operation of other influences
<span class="sidenote">Comedy.</span>
produced a wide variety of growths. The germs of most
of these&mdash;though not of all&mdash;are to be found in the works of the
most versatile, the most sure-footed, and, in some respects,
the most consummate master of the comic drama whom the
<span class="sidenote">Molière.</span>
world has known&mdash;Molière. What Molière found in
existence was a comedy of intrigue, derived from
Spanish or Italian examples, and the elements of a comedy of
character, in French and more especially in Italian farce and
ballet-pantomime. Corneille&rsquo;s <i>Menteur</i> had pointed the way to
a fuller combination of character with intrigue, and in this
direction Molière&rsquo;s genius exercised the height of its creative
powers. After beginning with farces, he produced in the earliest
of his plays (from 1652), of which more than fragments remain,
comedies of intrigue which are at the same time marvellously
lively pictures of manners, and then proceeded, with the <i>École
des maris</i> (1661), to begin a long series of masterpieces of comedy
of character. Yet even these, the chief of which are altogether
unrivalled in dramatic literature, do not exhaust the variety
of his productions. To define the range of his art is as difficult
as to express in words the essence of his genius. For though he
has been copied ever since he wrote, neither his spirit nor his
manner has descended in full to any of his copyists, whole schools
of whom have missed elements of both. A Molière can only be
judged in his relations to the history of comedy at large. He
was indeed the inheritor of many forms and styles&mdash;remaining
a stranger to those of Old Attic comedy only, rooted as it was
in the political life of a free imperial city; though even the rich
extravagances of Aristophanes&rsquo; burlesque was not left wholly
unreproduced by him. Molière is both a satirist and a humorist;
he displays at times the sentiments of a loyal courtier, at others
that gay spirit of opposition which is all but indispensable to
a popular French wit. His comedies offer elaborate and subtle&mdash;even
tender&mdash;pictures of human character in its eternal types,
lively sketches of social follies and literary extravagances, and
broad appeals to the ordinary sources of vulgar merriment.
Light and perspicuous in construction, he is master of the delicate
play of irony, the penetrating force of wit, and the expansive
gaiety of frolicsome fun. Faithful to the canons of artistic taste,
and under the sure guidance of true natural humour, his style
suits itself to every species attempted by him. His morality is the
reverse of rigid, but its aberrations are not those of prurience,
nor its laws those of pretence; and, wholly free as he was from
the didactic aim which is foreign to all true dramatic representation,
the services rendered by him to his art are not the less
services rendered to society, concerning which the laughter of
genuine comedy tells the truth. He raised the comedy of character
out of the lower sphere of caricature, and in his greatest
creations subordinated to the highest ends of all dramatic
composition the plots he so skilfully built, and the pictures of
the manners he so faithfully reproduced.</p>

<p>Even among the French comic dramatists of this age there
must have been many who &ldquo;were not aware&rdquo; that Molière
was its greatest poet. For though he had made the true
path luminous to them, their efforts were still often
<span class="sidenote">Molière&rsquo;s contemporaries and successors.</span>
of a tentative kind, and one was reviving <i>Pathelin</i>
while another was translating the <i>Andria</i>. A more
unique attempt was made in one of the very few really
modern versions of an Aristophanic comedy, which deserves to
be called an original copy&mdash;the <i>Plaideurs</i> of Racine. The tragic
poets Quinault and Campistron likewise wrote comedies, one<a name="fa122a" id="fa122a" href="#ft122a"><span class="sp">122</span></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page514" id="page514"></a>514</span>
or more of which furnished materials to contemporary English
dramatists, as did one of the felicitous plays in which Boursault
introduced Mercury and Aesop into the theatrical <i>salon</i>.<a name="fa123a" id="fa123a" href="#ft123a"><span class="sp">123</span></a> Antoine
Montfleury (1640-1685), Baron and Dancourt, who were actors
like Molière, likewise wrote comedies. But if the mantle of
Molière can be said to have fallen upon any of his contemporaries
or successors, this honour must be ascribed to J. F. Regnard,
who imitated the great master in both themes and characters,<a name="fa124a" id="fa124a" href="#ft124a"><span class="sp">124</span></a>
while the skilfulness of his plots, and his gaiety of the treatment
even of subjects tempting into the by-path of sentimental
comedy,<a name="fa125a" id="fa125a" href="#ft125a"><span class="sp">125</span></a> entitle him to be regarded as a comic poet of original
genius. With him C. R. Dufresny occasionally collaborated.</p>

<p>In the next generation (that of Voltaire) comedy gradually&mdash;but
only gradually&mdash;surrendered for a time the very essence of
its vitality to the seductions of a hybrid species, which disguised
its identity under more than a single name. A. R. le Sage,
who as a comic dramatist at first followed successfully in the
footsteps of Molière, proved himself on the stage as well as in
picturesque fiction a keen observer and inimitable satirist of
human life.<a name="fa126a" id="fa126a" href="#ft126a"><span class="sp">126</span></a> The light texture of the playful and elegant art
of J. B. L. Gresset was shown on the stage in a character comedy
of merit;<a name="fa127a" id="fa127a" href="#ft127a"><span class="sp">127</span></a> and in a comedy which reveals something of his
pointed wit, A. Piron produced something like a new type of
enduring ridiculousness.<a name="fa128a" id="fa128a" href="#ft128a"><span class="sp">128</span></a> P. C. de Marivaux, the French
<i>Spectator</i>, is usually supposed to have formed the connecting
link between the &ldquo;old&rdquo; French comedy and the &ldquo;new&rdquo; and
bastard variety. Yet, though his minute analysis of the tender
passion excited the scorn of Voltaire, it should not be overlooked
that in <i>marivaudage</i> proper the wit holds the balance to the
sentiment, and that in some of this frequently misjudged writer&rsquo;s
earlier and most delightful plays the elegance and gaiety of diction
are as irresistible as the pathetic sentiment, which is in fact rather
an ingredient in his comedy than the pervading characteristic of
it.<a name="fa129a" id="fa129a" href="#ft129a"><span class="sp">129</span></a> Some of the comedies of P. H. Destouches no doubt have a
serious basis, and in his later plays he comes near to a kind of
drama in which the comic purpose has been virtually submerged.<a name="fa130a" id="fa130a" href="#ft130a"><span class="sp">130</span></a>
The writer who is actually to be credited with the
transition to sentimental comedy, and who was fully conscious
of the change which he was helping to effect, was Nivelle de La
Chaussée, in whose hands French comedy became a champion of
the sanctity of marriage, and reproduced the sentiments&mdash;in
one instance even the characters&mdash;of Richardson.<a name="fa131a" id="fa131a" href="#ft131a"><span class="sp">131</span></a> To his play
<i>La Fausse Antipathie</i> the author supplied a <i>critique</i>, amounting
to an apology for the new species of which it was designed as
an example.</p>

<p>The new species known as <i>comédie larmoyante</i> was now fairly
in the ascendant; and it would be easy to show how even
Voltaire, who had deprecated the innovation, had to yield to a
power greater than his own, and introduced the sentimental
element into some of his comedies.<a name="fa132a" id="fa132a" href="#ft132a"><span class="sp">132</span></a> The further step, by which
<i>comédie larmoyante</i> was transformed into <i>tragédie bourgeoise</i>,
from which the comic element was to all intents and purposes
extruded, was taken by a great French writer, D. Diderot; to
whose influence it was largely due that the species which had
attained to this consummation for more than a generation ruled
supreme in the dramatic literature of Europe. But the final
impulse, as Diderot himself virtually acknowledged in the
<i>entretiens</i> subjoined by him to his <i>Fils naturel</i> (1757), had been
given by a far humbler citizen of the world of letters, the author
of <i>The London Merchant</i>. Diderot&rsquo;s own plays were a literary
rather than a theatrical success. <i>Le Fils naturel ou les épreuves
de la vertu</i> was not publicly performed till 1771, and then only
in deference to the determination of a single actor of the Français
(Molé); nor was the performance of it repeated. Diderot&rsquo;s
second play, <i>Le Père de famille</i>, printed in 1758 with a <i>Discours
sur la poésie dramatique</i>, went through a few public performances
in 1761; and a later revival was unsuccessful. But &ldquo;at a
distance,&rdquo; as was well said, the effect of Diderot&rsquo;s endeavours, the
earlier in particular, was extremely great, and Lessing, though
very critical as to particular points, greatly helped to spread it.
Diderot had for the first time consciously sought to proclaim the
theatre an agency of social reform, and to entrust to it as its
task the propagation of the gospel of philanthropy. Though
the execution of his dramatic works fell far short of his aims;
though Madame de Staël was not far wrong in denouncing them
as exhibiting not nature itself, but &ldquo;the affectation of nature,&rdquo;
yet they contained, in a measure almost unequalled in the history
of the modern drama, the fermenting element which never seems
to subside. Their author announced them as examples of a third
dramatic form&mdash;the <i>genre sérieux</i>&mdash;which he declared to be the
consummation of the dramatic art. Making war upon the frigid
artificiality of classical tragedy, he banished verse from the new
species. The effect of these plays was intended to spring from
their truth to nature&mdash;a truth such as no spectator could mistake,
and which should bring home its moral teachings to the business
as well as the bosoms of all. The theatre was to become a real
and realistic school of the principles of society and of the conduct
of life&mdash;it was, in other words, to usurp functions with which
it has no concern, and to essay the direct reformation of mankind.
The idea was neither new nor just; but its speciousness will
probably continue to commend it to many enthusiastic minds,
whensoever and in whatsoever shape it is revived.</p>

<p>From this point the history of the French drama becomes
that of a conflict between an enfeebled artistic school and a
tendency which is hardly to be dignified by the name
of a school at all. Among the successful dramatists
<span class="sidenote">The comedy of the Revolution and the first empire.</span>
following on Diderot may be mentioned the critical
and versatile J. F. Marmontel, and more especially
M. J. Sedaine, who though chiefly working for the opera,
produced two comedies of acknowledged merit.<a name="fa133a" id="fa133a" href="#ft133a"><span class="sp">133</span></a> P. A. C.
de Beaumarchais (1732-1799), who for his early sentimental
plays,<a name="fa134a" id="fa134a" href="#ft134a"><span class="sp">134</span></a> in which he imitated Diderot, invented the appellation
<i>drame</i>&mdash;so convenient in its vagueness that it became the
accepted name of the hybrid species to which they belonged&mdash;in
two works of a very different kind, the famous <i>Barbier de Séville</i>
and the still more famous <i>Mariage de Figaro</i>, boldly carried
comedy back into its old Spanish atmosphere of intrigue; but,
while surpassing all his predecessors in the skill with which he
constructed his frivolous plots, he drew his characters with a
lightness and sureness of touch peculiar to himself, animated
his dialogue with an unparalleled brilliancy of wit, and seasoned
action as well as dialogue with a political and social meaning,
which caused his epigrams to become proverbs, and which marks
his <i>Figaro</i> as a herald of the Revolution. Such plays as these
were ill suited to the rule of the despot whose vigilance could not
overlook their significance. The comedy of the empire is, in the
hands of Collin d&rsquo;Harleville, Louis Picard (1769-1828), A. Duval,
Étienne and others, mainly a harmless comedy of manners;
nor was the attempted innovation of N. Lemercier&mdash;who was
fain to invent a new species, that of historical comedy&mdash;more than
a flattering self-delusion. The theatre had its share in all the
movements and changes which ensued in France; though the
most important revolution which the drama itself was to undergo
was not one of wholly native origin. Those branches of the
drama which belong specifically to the history of the opera, or
which associate themselves with it, are here passed by. Among
them was the <i>vaudeville</i> (from Val de Vire in Calvados), which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page515" id="page515"></a>515</span>
began as an interspersion of pantomime with the airs of popular
songs, and which, after the Italian masks had been removed
<span class="sidenote">Vaudevilles, etc.</span>
from it, was cultivated by Ponsard and Marmontel,
while Sedaine wrote a didactic poem on the subject
(1756). Sedaine was the father of the <i>opéra-comique</i>
proper;<a name="fa135a" id="fa135a" href="#ft135a"><span class="sp">135</span></a> Marmontel,<a name="fa136a" id="fa136a" href="#ft136a"><span class="sp">136</span></a> as well as Rousseau,<a name="fa137a" id="fa137a" href="#ft137a"><span class="sp">137</span></a> likewise composed
<i>opérettes</i>&mdash;a smaller sort of opera, at first of the pastoral variety;
and these flexible species easily entered into combination. The
melodrama proper, of which the invention is also attributed to
Rousseau,<a name="fa138a" id="fa138a" href="#ft138a"><span class="sp">138</span></a> in its latter development became merely a drama
accentuated by music, though usually in little need of any
accentuation.</p>

<p>The chief home of the regular drama, however, demanded
efforts of another kind. At the Théâtre Français, or Comédie
Française, whose history as that of a single company
of actors had begun in 1680, the party-strife of the
<span class="sidenote">The stage.</span>
times made itself audible; and the most prominent tragic
poet of the Revolution, M. J. de Chénier, a disciple of Voltaire
in dramatic poetry as well as in political philosophy, wrote for
the national stage the historical drama&mdash;with a political moral<a name="fa139a" id="fa139a" href="#ft139a"><span class="sp">139</span></a>&mdash;in
which in the memorable year 1789 the actor Talma achieved
his first complete triumph. But the victorious Revolution
proclaimed among other liberties that of the theatres in Paris,
of which soon not less than 50 were open. In 1807 the empire
restricted the number to 9, and reinstated the Théâtre Français
in sole possession (or nearly such) of the right of performing the
<span class="sidenote">Transition to the romantic school.</span>
classic drama. No writer of note was, however,
tempted or inspired by the rewards and other encouragements
offered by Napoleon to produce such a
classic tragedy as the emperor would have willingly
stamped from out of the earth. The tragedies of C. Delavigne
represent the transition from the expiring efforts of the classical
to the ambitious beginnings of the romantic school of the French
drama.</p>

<p>Of modern romantic drama in France it must suffice to say
that it derives some of its characteristics from the general
movement of romanticism which in various ways and
at various points of time transformed nearly every
<span class="sidenote">The romantic school.</span>
modern European literature, others from the rhetorical
tendency which is a French national feature. Victor
Hugo was the founder whom it followed in a spirit of high emprise
to success upon success, his own being the most conspicuous of
all;<a name="fa140a" id="fa140a" href="#ft140a"><span class="sp">140</span></a> A. Dumas the elder its unshrinking middleman. The
marvellous fire and grandeur of genius of the former, always in
extremes but often most sublime at the height of danger, was
nowhere more signally such than in the drama; Dumas was a
Briareus, working, however, with many hands besides his own.
Together with them may, with more or less precision, be classed
in the romantic school of dramatists A. de Vigny<a name="fa141a" id="fa141a" href="#ft141a"><span class="sp">141</span></a> and George
Sand,<a name="fa142a" id="fa142a" href="#ft142a"><span class="sp">142</span></a> neither of whom, however, attained to the highest rank
in the drama, and Jules Sandeau;<a name="fa143a" id="fa143a" href="#ft143a"><span class="sp">143</span></a> A. de Musset, whose originality
pervades all his plays, but whose later works, more especially
in his prose &ldquo;proverbs&rdquo; and pieces of a similar kind, have a
flavour of a delicacy altogether indescribable;<a name="fa144a" id="fa144a" href="#ft144a"><span class="sp">144</span></a> perhaps also
P. Mérimée (1803-1870), who invented not only Spanish dramas
but a Spanish dramatist, and who was never more audacious
than when he seemed most <i>naïf</i>.<a name="fa145a" id="fa145a" href="#ft145a"><span class="sp">145</span></a></p>

<p>The romantic school was not destined to exercise a permanent
control over French public taste; but it can hardly be said to
have been overthrown by the brief classical revival begun by
F. Ponsard, and continued, though in closer contact with modern
ideas, both by him<a name="fa146a" id="fa146a" href="#ft146a"><span class="sp">146</span></a> and by E. Augier, a dramatist who
gradually attained to an extraordinary effectiveness in the self-restrained
<span class="sidenote">Modern schools.</span>
treatment of social as well as of historical
themes.<a name="fa147a" id="fa147a" href="#ft147a"><span class="sp">147</span></a> While the theatrical fecundity and the
remarkable constructive ability of E. Scribe<a name="fa148a" id="fa148a" href="#ft148a"><span class="sp">148</span></a> supplied
a long series of productions attesting the rapid growth of the
playwright&rsquo;s mastery over the secrets of his craft the name of his
competitors is legion. Among them may be mentioned, if only
as the authors of two of the most successful plays of the historical
species produced in the century, two writers of great eminence&mdash;C.
Delavigne<a name="fa149a" id="fa149a" href="#ft149a"><span class="sp">149</span></a> and E. Legouvé.<a name="fa150a" id="fa150a" href="#ft150a"><span class="sp">150</span></a> Later developments of the
drama bore the impress of a period of social decay, prepared to
probe its own sufferings, while glad at times to take refuge in
the gaiety traditional in France in her more light-hearted days,
but which even then had not yet deserted either French social
life or the theatre which reflected it. After a fashion which
would have startled even Diderot, while recalling his efforts
in the earnestness of its endeavour to arouse moral interests
to which the theatre had long been a stranger, A. Dumas the
younger set himself to reform society by means of the stage.<a name="fa151a" id="fa151a" href="#ft151a"><span class="sp">151</span></a>
But the technical skill which he and contemporary dramatists
displayed in the execution of their self-imposed task was such as
had been undreamt of by Diderot. O. Feuillet, more eminent
as a novelist than on the stage, applied himself, though with
the aid of fewer prefaces, to the solution of the same or similar
problems; while the extraordinary versatility of V. Sardou
and his unfailing constructive skill was applied by him to almost
every kind of serious, or serio-comic, drama&mdash;even the most
solid of all.<a name="fa152a" id="fa152a" href="#ft152a"><span class="sp">152</span></a> In the same period, while E. Pailleron revived some
of the most characteristic tendencies of the best French satirical
comedy in ridiculing the pompous pretentiousness of learning
for its own sake,<a name="fa153a" id="fa153a" href="#ft153a"><span class="sp">153</span></a> the light-hearted gaiety of E. Labiche changed
into something not altogether similar in the productions of the
comic muse of L. Halévy and H. Meilhac, ranging from the
licence of the musical burlesque which was the congenial delight
of the later days of the Second Empire to a species of comedy
in which the ingredients of bitterness and even of sadness found
a place.<a name="fa154a" id="fa154a" href="#ft154a"><span class="sp">154</span></a></p>

<p>Dramatic criticism in France has had a material share in the
maintenance of a deep as well as wide national interest in the
preservation of a high standard of excellence both in
the performance of plays and in the plays themselves.
<span class="sidenote">Tendencies of the drama and of the theatre in France.</span>
Among its modern representatives the foremost place
would probably be by common consent allowed to
F. Sarcey, whose Monday theatrical <i>feuilleton</i> in the
<i>Temps</i> was long awaited week by week as an oracle of
dramaturgy. But he was only the first among equals, and the
successor and the predecessor of writers who have at least
sought to be equal to a function of real public importance. For
it seems hardly within the range of probability to suppose that
the theatre will for many a generation to come lose the hold
which it has established over the intellectual and moral sympathies
of nearly the whole of the educated&mdash;to say nothing of a
great part of the half-educated&mdash;population of France. This
does not, of course, imply that the creative activity of French
dramatic literature is certain to endure. Since the great changes
set in which were consequent upon the disastrous war of 1870,
French dramatic literature has reflected more than one phase of
national sentiment and opinion, and has represented the aspirations,
the sympathies and the philosophy of life of more than one
class in the community. Thus it has had its episodes of reaction
in the midst of an onward flow of which it would be difficult to
predict the end. The tendency of what can only vaguely be
described as the naturalistic school of writers has corresponded
to that even more prominent in the dramatic literatures of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page516" id="page516"></a>516</span>
certain other European nations; but it must be allowed that a
new poetic will have to be constructed if the freedom of development
which the dramatic, like all other arts, is entitled to
claim is to be reconciled to laws deducible from the whole
previous history of the drama. The reaction towards earlier
forms has asserted itself in various ways&mdash;through the poetic
plays of the later years of F. Coppée; in the success (notable for
reasons other than artistic) of Vicomte H. de Bornier&rsquo;s first
tragedy; and of late more especially in the dramas&mdash;highly
original and truly romantic in both form and treatment&mdash;of
E. Rostand.</p>

<p>The art of acting is not altogether dependent upon the measure
of contemporary literary productivity, even in France, where
the connexion between dramatic literature and the stage has
perhaps been more continuously intimate than in many other
countries. Talma and Mlle Mars flourished in one of the most
barren ages of the French literary drama; and though this
cannot be asserted of the two most brilliant stars of the French
19th century tragic stage, Rachel and Sarah Bernhardt, or of
their comic contemporaries from Frédérick-Lemaître down to
types less unique than the &ldquo;Talma of the boulevards,&rdquo; the
constantly accumulating experience of the successive schools
of acting in France may here ensure to the art a future not less
notable than its past. Moreover, the French theatre has long
been, and is more than ever likely to continue, an affair of the
state as well as of the nation; and the judicious policy of not
leaving the chief theatres at the mercy of shifting fashion and
the base demands of idleness and sensuality will remain the
surest guarantee for the maintenance of a high standard both in
principle and in practice. So long as France continues to maintain
her ascendancy over other nations in matters of taste, and
in much else that adorns, brightens and quickens social life,
the predominant influence of the French theatre over the theatres
of other nations is likewise assured. But dramatic literature is
becoming international to a degree hardly dreamt of half a
century ago; and the distinctive development of the French
theatre cannot fail to be affected by the success or failure of the
national drama in retaining and developing its own most characteristic
qualities. Its history shows periods of marvellously
rapid advance, of hardly less swift decline, and of frequent
though at times fitful recovery. Its future may be equally
varied; but it will remain not less dependent on the conditions
which in every people, ancient or modern, have proved to be
indispensable to national vigour and vitality.</p>
<div class="author">(A. W. W.)</div>

<p><i>Recent French Drama.</i>&mdash;The last twenty-five years of the 19th
century witnessed an important change in the constructive
methods, as well as in the moral tendencies, of the French playwrights.
Of the two leading dramatists who reigned supreme
over the <i>haute comédie</i> in 1875, one, Émile Augier, had almost
ended his career, but the other, Alexandre Dumas, was to maintain
his ascendancy for many years longer. Sardou&rsquo;s fertility
of invention, and extraordinary cleverness at manipulating a
complicated intrigue, were also greatly admired, and much was
expected from Edouard Pailleron&rsquo;s brilliant and&mdash;as it seemed&mdash;inexhaustible
wit in satirizing the whims and weaknesses of
high-born and highly-cultured society. Alexandre Dumas had
created and still monopolized the problem play, of which <i>Le
Demi-monde</i>, <i>Le Fils naturel</i>, <i>La Question d&rsquo;argent</i>, <i>Les Idées de
Madame Aubray</i>, <i>La Femme de Claude</i>, <i>Monsieur Alphonse</i>, <i>La
Visite de noces</i>, <i>L&rsquo;Étrangère</i>, <i>Francillon</i> and <i>Denise</i> may be
mentioned as the most characteristic specimens. The problem
play is the presentation of a particular case, with a view to a
general conclusion on some important question of human conduct.
This afforded the author, who was, in his way, a moralist and a
reformer, excellent opportunities for humorous discussions and
the display of that familiar eloquence which was his greatest
gift and most effective faculty. Among other subjects, the social
position of women had an all-powerful attraction for his mind,
and many of his later plays were written with the object of
placing in strong relief the remarkable inequality of the sexes,
both as regards freedom of action and responsibility, in modern
marriage. Like all the dramatists of his time, he adhered to
Scribe&rsquo;s mode of play-writing&mdash;a mixture of the <i>drame bourgeois</i>,
as initiated by Diderot, and the comedy of character and manners,
long in vogue&mdash;from the days of Molière, Regnard, Destouches
and Marivaux, down to the beginning of the 19th century. In
his prefaces Dumas often undertook the defence of the system
which, in his estimation, was best calculated to serve the purpose
of the artist, the humorist and the moralist&mdash;a dramatist being,
as he conceived, a combination of the three.</p>

<p>Though the majority of French playgoers continued to side
with him, and to cling to the time-honoured theatrical beliefs,
a few young men were beginning to murmur against the too
elaborate mechanism and artificial logic. Scribe and his successors,
whose plays were a combination of comedy and drama,
were wont to devote the first act to a brilliant and witty presentation
of personages, then to crowd the following scenes with
incidents, until the action was brought to a climax about the
end of the fourth act, invariably concluding, in the fifth, with an
optimistic <i>dénouement</i>, just before midnight, the time appointed
by police regulations for the closing of playhouses. At the same
time a more serious and far-reaching criticism was levelled at the
very principles on which the conception of human life was then
dependent. A new philosophy, based on scientific research,
had been gradually gaining ground and penetrating the French
mind. A host of bold writers had been trying, with considerable
firmness and continuity of purpose, to start a new kind of fiction,
writing in perfect accordance with the determinist theories of
Auguste Comte, Darwin and Taine. The long-disputed success
of the Naturalistic School carried everything before it during
the years 1875-1885, and its triumphant leaders were tempted
to make the best of their advantage by annexing a new province
and establishing a footing on the stage. In this they failed
signally, either when they were assisted by professional dramatists
or when left to their own resources. It became evident that
Naturalism, to be made acceptable on the stage, would have to
undergo a special process of transformation and be handled in a
peculiar way. Henry Becque succeeded in embodying the new
theories in two plays, which at first met with very indifferent
success, but were revived at a later period, and finally obtained
permanent recognition in the French theatre&mdash;even with the
acquiescence of the most learned critics, when they discovered,
or fancied they discovered, that Becque&rsquo;s comedies agreed, in
the main, with Molière&rsquo;s conception of dramatic art. In <i>Les
Corbeaux</i> and <i>La Parisienne</i> the plot is very simple; the episodes
are incidents taken from ordinary life. No extraneous character
is introduced to discuss moral and social theories, or to acquaint
us with the psychology of the real <i>dramatis personae</i>, or to suggest
humorous observations about the progress of the dramatic action.
The characters are left to tell their own tale in their own words,
which are sometimes very comical, sometimes very repulsive,
but purport to be always true to nature. Human will, which
was the soul and mainspring of French tragedy in the 17th
century, and played such a paramount part in the <i>drame bourgeois</i>
and the <i>haute comédie</i> of the 19th, appears in M. Becque&rsquo;s plays
to have fallen from its former exalted position and to have ceased
to be a free agent. It is a mere passive instrument to our inner
desires and instincts and appetites, which, in their turn, obey
natural laws. Thus, in Becque&rsquo;s comedies, as in the old Greek
drama, destiny, not man, is the chief actor, the real but unseen
protagonist.</p>

<p>Becque was not a prolific writer, and when he died, in 1899,
it was remarked that he had spent the last ten years of his life in
comparative inactivity. But during these years his young and
ardent disciples had spared no effort in putting their master&rsquo;s
theories to the test. It had occurred to a gifted and enterprising
actor-manager, named André Antoine, that the time had come
for trying dramatic experiments in a continued and methodical
manner. For this purpose he gathered around him a number
of young authors, and produced their plays before a select
audience of subscribers, who had paid in advance for their season-tickets.
The entertainment was a strictly private one. In this
way Antoine made himself independent of the censors, and at the
same time was no longer obliged to consider the requirements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page517" id="page517"></a>517</span>
of the average playgoer, as is the case with ordinary managers,
anxious, above all things, to secure long runs. At the Théâtre
Libre the most successful play was not to be performed for more
than three nights.</p>

<p>The reform attempted was to consist in the elimination of what
was contrary to nature in Dumas&rsquo;s and Augier&rsquo;s comedies: of
the <i>intrigue parallèle</i> or underplot, of the over-numerous and
improbable incidents which followed the first act and taxed the
spectator&rsquo;s memory to the verge of fatigue; and, lastly, of the
conventional <i>dénouement</i> for which there was no justification.
A true study of character was to take the place of Sardou&rsquo;s
complicated fabrications and Dumas&rsquo;s problem plays. The
authors would present the spectator with a fragment of life, but
would force no conclusion upon him at the termination of the
play. The reformation in histrionic art was to proceed apace.
The actors and actresses of the preceding period had striven
to give full effect to certain witty utterances of the author, or to
preserve and to develop their own personal peculiarities or
oddities. Antoine and his fellow-artists did their best to make
the public realize, in every word and every gesture, the characteristic
features and ruling passions of the men and women they were
supposed to represent.</p>

<p>It was in the early autumn of 1887 that the Théâtre Libre
opened its doors for the first time. It struggled on for eight
years amidst unfailing curiosity, but not without encountering
some adverse, or even derisive, criticism from a considerable
portion of the public and the press. The Théâtre Libre brought
under public notice such men as George Courteline and George
Ancey, who gave respectively, in <i>Bonbouroche</i> and <i>La Dupe</i>,
specimens of a comic vein called the &ldquo;<i>comique cruel</i>.&rdquo; Fabre, in
<i>L&rsquo;Argent</i>, approached if not surpassed his master, Henry Becque.
Brieux, in <i>Blanchette</i>, gave promise of talent, which he has since
in a great measure justified. In <i>Les Fossiles</i> and <i>L&rsquo;Envers d&rsquo;une
sainte</i>, by François de Curel, were found evidences of dramatic
vigour and concentrated energy, allied with a remarkable gift
for the minute analysis of feeling. Antoine&rsquo;s activity was not
exclusively confined to the efforts of the French Naturalistic
School; he included the Norwegian drama in his programme,
and successively produced several of Ibsen&rsquo;s plays. They
received a large amount of attention from the critics, the views
then expressed ranging from the wildest enthusiasm to the
bitterest irony. Francisque Sarcey was decidedly hostile, and
Jules Lemaître, who ranked next to him in authority, ventured
to suggest that Ibsen&rsquo;s ideas were nothing better than long-discarded
social and literary paradoxes, borrowed from Pierre
Leroux through George Sand, and returned to the French
market as novelties. Ibsen was not understood by the French
public at large, though his influence could be clearly traced on
thoughtful men like Paul Hervieu and François de Curel.</p>

<p>The authors of the Théâtre Libre were sadly wanting in tact
and patience. They went at once to extremes, and, while trying
to free themselves from an obsolete form of drama, fell into a state
of anarchy. If a too elaborate plot is a fault, no plot at all is an
absurdity. The old school had been severely taken to task for
devoting the first act to the delineation of character, and the
delineation of character was now found to have extended over
the whole play; and worse still, most of these young men
seemed to find pleasure in importing a low vocabulary on to the
stage; they made it their special object to place before the spectator
revolting pictures of the grossest immorality. In this they
were supported by a knot of noisy and unwise admirers, whose
misplaced approval largely contributed towards bringing an
otherwise useful and interesting undertaking into disrepute.
The result was that after the lapse of eight years the little group
collected round Antoine had lost in cohesion and spirit, that it was
both less hopeful and less compact than it had been at the outset
of the campaign. But some authors who had kept aloof from
the movement were not slow in reaping the moral and intellectual
profit of these tentative experiments. Among them must be
cited George de Porto-Riche, Henri Lavedan, Paul Hervieu,
Maurice Donnay and Jules Lemaître. Alone among the authors
of the Théâtre Libre, É. Brieux secured an assured position on
the regular stage. Instead of attacking the vices and follies of his
times, he has made a name by satirizing the weak points or the
wrong application of certain fundamental principles by which
modern institutions are supported. He mocked at universal
suffrage in <i>L&rsquo;Engrenage</i>, at art in <i>Ménages d&rsquo;artistes</i>, at popular
instruction in <i>Blanchette</i>, at charity in <i>Les Bienfaiteurs</i>, at
science in <i>L&rsquo;Évasion</i>, and then at law in <i>La Robe rouge</i>.
Of <i>Les Trois Filles de M. Dupont</i>, one is an old maid with a strong
bent towards mysticism, another is a star in the demi-monde,
and the third is married. Neither religion, nor free love, nor
marriage has made one of the three happy. The strange fact
about Brieux is that he propounds his uncomfortable ideas with
an incredible amount of dash and spirit.</p>

<p>All the plays written by the above-mentioned authors, and by
those who follow in their steps, have been said to constitute
the &ldquo;new comedy.&rdquo; But one may question the advisability
of applying the same name to literary works which present so
little, if any, family likeness. It was tacitly agreed to remove
the intricacies of the plot and the forced <i>dénouement</i>. But no one
will trace in those plays the uniformity of moral purpose which
would justify us in comprising them under the same head, as
products of the same school. Then, before the Naturalistic,
or half-Naturalistic, School had attained to a practical result or
taken a definite shape, a wave of Romanticism swept over the
French public, and in a measure brought back the old artistic
and literary dogmas propounded by Victor Hugo and the generation
of 1830. Signs of a revival in French dramatic poetry were
not lacking. The success of <i>La Fille de Roland</i>, by the Vicomte
de Bornier, was restricted to the more cultivated classes, but the
vogue of Jean Richepin&rsquo;s <i>Chemineau</i> was at once general and
lasting. <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>, produced in the last days of 1897,
brought a world-wide reputation to its young author, Edmond
Rostand. This play combines sparkling wit and brilliancy
of imagination with delightful touches of pathos and delicate
tenderness. It was assumed that Rostand was endowed to an
extraordinary degree both with theatrical genius and the poetic
faculty. <i>L&rsquo;Aiglon</i> fell short of this too favourable judgment.
It is more a dramatic poem than a real drama, and the author
handles history with the same childish incompetence and inaccuracy
as Hugo did in <i>Cromwell</i>, in <i>Ruy Blas</i> and <i>Hernani</i>.
The persistent approbation of the public seemed, however, to
indicate a growing taste for poetry, even when unsupported by
dramatic interest&mdash;a curious symptom among the least poetical
of modern European races.</p>

<p>To sum up, the French, as regards the present condition of
their drama, were confronted with two alternative movements.
Naturalism, furthered by science and philosophy, was contending
against traditions three centuries old, and seemed unable to
crystallize into masterly works; while romantic drama, founded
on vague and exploded theories, had become embodied in productions
of real artistic beauty, which have been warmly welcomed
by the general playgoer. It should nevertheless be noted
that in <i>Cyrano</i> and <i>L&rsquo;Aiglon</i> human will, which was the main-spring
of Corneille&rsquo;s tragedy and Hugo&rsquo;s drama, tried to reassert
itself, but was baffled by circumstance, and had to submit to
inexorable laws. This showed that the victorious school would
have to reckon with the doctrines of the defeated party, and
suggested that a determinist theatre might be the ultimate
outcome of a compromise.</p>

<p class="center pt2">(f) <i>English Drama.</i></p>

<p>Among the nations of Germanic descent the English alone
succeeded, mainly through the influence of the Renaissance
movement, in transforming the later growths of the medieval
drama into the beginnings of a great and enduring national
dramatic literature, second neither in volume nor in splendour
to any other in the records of the world. And, although in
England, as elsewhere, the preparatory process had been continuing
for some generations, its consummation coincided with
one of the greatest epochs of English national history, and indeed
forms one of the chief glories of that epoch itself; so that, in
thinking or speaking of the Elizabethan age and the Elizabethan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>518</span>
drama, the one can scarcely be thought or spoken of without
the other.</p>

<p>It is of course conceivable that the regular drama, or drama
proper, might in England have been called into life without the
direct influence of classical examples. Already in the
reign of Edward VI. the spirit of the Reformation had
<span class="sidenote">Beginnings of the regular drama.</span>
(with the aid of a newly awakened desire for the study
of history, which was no doubt largely due to Italian
examples) quickened the relatively inanimate species of the
morality into the beginning of a new development.<a name="fa155a" id="fa155a" href="#ft155a"><span class="sp">155</span></a> But
though the <i>Kyng Johan</i> of Bale (much as this author abhorred
the chronicles as written by ecclesiastics) came very near to the
chronicle histories, there is no proof whatever that the work,
long hidden away for very good reasons, actually served as a
transition to the new species; and Bale&rsquo;s production was entirely
unknown to the particular chronicle history which treated the
same subject. Before the earliest example of this transitional
species was produced, English tragedy had directly connected
its beginnings with classical models.</p>

<p>Much in the same way, nothing could have been more natural
and in accordance with the previous sluggish evolution of the
English drama than that a gradual transition, however complete
in the end, should have been effected from the moralities to
comedy. It was not, however, John Heywood himself who was
to accomplish any such transition; possibly, he was himself
the author of the morality <i>Genus humanum</i> performed at the
coronation feast of Queen Mary, whose council speedily forbade
the performance of interludes without the queen&rsquo;s licence. Nor
are we able to conjecture the nature of the pieces bearing this
name composed by Richard Farrant, afterwards the master of
the Children of St George&rsquo;s at Windsor, or of William Hunnis,
master under Queen Elizabeth of the Children of the Chapel
Royal. But the process of transition is visible in productions,
also called interludes, but charged with serious purpose, such
as T. Ingeland&rsquo;s noteworthy <i>Disobedient Child</i> (before 1560),
and plays in which the element of abstractions is perceptibly
yielding to that of real personages, or in which the characters
are for the most part historical or the main element in the action
belongs to the sphere of romantic narrative.<a name="fa156a" id="fa156a" href="#ft156a"><span class="sp">156</span></a> The demonstration
would, however, be alien to the purpose of indicating the main
conditions of the growth of the English drama. The immediate
origin of the earliest extant English comedy must, like that of
<span class="sidenote">Imitation of classical examples.</span>
the first English tragedy, be sought, not in the development
of any popular literary or theatrical antecedents,
but in the imitation, more or less direct, of classical
models. This cardinal fact, unmistakable though it
is, has frequently been ignored or obscured by writers intent
upon investigating the <i>origines</i> of our drama, and to this day
remains without adequate acknowledgment in most of the
literary histories accessible to the great body of students.</p>

<p>It is true that in tracing the entrance of the drama into the
national literature there is no reason for seeking to distinguish
very narrowly between the several tributaries to the main stream
which fertilized this as well as other fields under Renaissance
culture. The universities then still remained, and for a time
became more prominently than ever, the leading agents of
education in all its existent stages; and it is a patent fact that
no influence could have been so strong upon the Elizabethan
dramatists as that to which they had been subjected during the
university life through which the large majority of them had
passed. The corporate life of the universities, and the enthusiasms
(habitually unanimous) of their undergraduates and
younger graduates, communicated this influence, as it were
automatically, to the students, and to the learned societies
themselves, of the Inns of Court. In the Tudor, as afterwards
in the early Stuart, times, these Inns were at once the seminaries
of loyalty, and the obvious resort for the supply of young men
of spirit desirous of honouring a learned court by contributing
to its choicer amusements. Thus, whether we trace them in
the universities, in the &ldquo;bowers&rdquo; or halls of the lawyers, or in
the palaces of the sovereign, the beginnings of the English
academical drama, which in later Elizabethan and Jacobean
literature cannot claim to be more than a subordinate species
of the national drama, in an earlier period served as the actual
link between classical tragedy and comedy and the surviving
native growths, and supplied the actual impulse towards the
beginnings of English tragedy and comedy.</p>

<p>The academical drama of the early years of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign
and of the preceding part of the Tudor period&mdash;including the
school-drama in the narrower sense of the term and
other performances of academical origin&mdash;consisted,
<span class="sidenote">The earlier academical drama.</span>
apart from actual reproductions of classical plays in
original Latin or in Latin versions of the Greek,
in adaptations of Latin originals, or of Latin or English plays
directly modelled on classical examples. A notable series of
plays of this kind was performed in the hall of Christ Church,
Oxford, from the first year of Edward VI. onward, when N.
Grimald&rsquo;s <i>Archipropheta</i>, treating in classic form the story of
St John the Baptist, but introducing the Vice and comic scenes,
was brought out.<a name="fa157a" id="fa157a" href="#ft157a"><span class="sp">157</span></a> Others were J. Calfhill&rsquo;s <i>Progne</i> and R.
Edwardes&rsquo; <i>Palaemon and Arcyte</i> (both 1566), and, from about
1580 onwards, a succession of Latin plays by William Gager,
beginning with the tragedy <i>Meleager</i>, and including, with other
tragedies,<a name="fa158a" id="fa158a" href="#ft158a"><span class="sp">158</span></a> a comedy <i>Rivales</i>. Yet another comedy, acted at
Christ Church, and extolled in 1591 by Harington for &ldquo;harmless
mirth,&rdquo; was the <i>Bellum grammaticale</i>, or Civil War between
Nouns and Verbs, which may have been a revision of a comedy
written by Bale&rsquo;s friend, R. Radcliff, in 1538, but of which in any
case the ultimate origin was a celebrated Italian allegorical
treatise.<a name="fa159a" id="fa159a" href="#ft159a"><span class="sp">159</span></a> In Cambridge, as is not surprising, the activity of the
early academical friends and favourers of the drama was even
more marked. At St John&rsquo;s College, where Bishop Watson&rsquo;s
Latin tragedy called <i>Absolom</i> was produced within the years
1534 and 1544, plays were, according to Ascham, repeatedly
performed about the middle of the century; at Christ&rsquo;s a
controversial drama in the Lutheran interest called <i>Pammachius</i>,
of which Gardiner complained to the privy council, and which
seems afterwards to have been translated by Bale, was acted in
1544; and at Trinity there was a long series of performances
which began with Christopherson&rsquo;s <i>Jephtha</i> about 1546, and
consisted partly of reproductions of classical works,<a name="fa160a" id="fa160a" href="#ft160a"><span class="sp">160</span></a> partly of
plays and &ldquo;shows&rdquo; unnamed; while on one occasion at all
events, in 1559, &ldquo;two English plays&rdquo; were produced. In 1560
was acted, doubtless in the original Latin, and not in Palsgrave&rsquo;s
English translation (1540) for schoolboys, the celebrated
&ldquo;comedy&rdquo; of <i>Acolastus</i>, by W. Gnaphaeus, on the story of the
Prodigal Son. The long series of Trinity plays interspersed with
occasional plays at King&rsquo;s (where Udall&rsquo;s <i>Ezechias</i> was produced
in English in 1564), at St John&rsquo;s (where T. Legge&rsquo;s <i>Richardus III.</i>
was first acted in 1573), and, as will be seen below, at Christ&rsquo;s,
continued, with few noticeable breaks, up to the time when
the Elizabethan drama was in full activity.<a name="fa161a" id="fa161a" href="#ft161a"><span class="sp">161</span></a> Among the
&ldquo;academical&rdquo; plays not traceable to any particular university
source may be mentioned, as acted at court so early as the end
of 1565 or the beginning of 1566, the Latin <i>Sapientia Solomonis</i>,
which generally follows the biblical narrative, but introduces a
comic element in the sayings of the popular Marcolph, who here
appears as a court fool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page519" id="page519"></a>519</span></p>

<p>It was under the direct influence of the Renaissance, viewed
primarily, in England as elsewhere, as a revival of classical
studies, and in connexion with the growing taste in
university and cognate circles of society, and at a
<span class="sidenote">Influence of Seneca.</span>
court which prided itself on its love and patronage of
learning, that English tragedy and comedy took their actual
beginnings. Those of comedy, as it would seem, preceded
those of tragedy by a few years. Already in Queen Mary&rsquo;s reign,
translation was found the readiest form of expression offering
itself to literary scholarship; and Italian examples helped to
commend Seneca, the most modern of the ancient tragedians,
and the imitator of the most human among the masters of Attic
tragedy, as a favourite subject for such exercises. In the very
year of Elizabeth&rsquo;s accession&mdash;seven years after Jodelle had
brought out the earliest French tragedy&mdash;a group of English
university scholars began to put forth a series of translations of
the ten tragedies of Seneca, which one of them, T. Newton, in
1581 collected into a single volume. The earliest of these
versions was that of the <i>Troades</i> (1559) by Jasper Heywood,
a son of the author of the <i>Interludes</i>. He also published the
<i>Thyestes</i> (1560) and the <i>Hercules Furens</i> (1561); the names of
his fellow-translators were A. Neville, T. Nuce, J. Studley and
the T. Newton aforesaid. These translations, which occasionally
include original interpolations (&ldquo;additions,&rdquo; a term which was
to become a technical one in English dramaturgy), are in no
instance in blank verse, the favourite metre of the dialogue being
the couplets of fourteen-syllable lines best known through
Chapman&rsquo;s <i>Homer</i>.</p>

<p>The authority of Seneca, once established in the English literary
world, maintained itself there long after English drama had
emancipated itself from the task of imitating this pallid
model, and, occasionally, Seneca&rsquo;s own prototype,
<span class="sidenote">Earliest English tragedies.</span>
Euripides.<a name="fa162a" id="fa162a" href="#ft162a"><span class="sp">162</span></a> Nor can it be doubted that some translation
of the Latin tragic poet had at one time or another
passed through Shakespeare&rsquo;s own hands. But what is of present
importance is that to the direct influence of Seneca is to be ascribed
the composition of the first English tragedy which we possess.
Of <i>Gorboduc</i> (afterwards re-named <i>Ferrex and Porrex</i>), first acted
on the 18th of January 1562 by the members of the Inner Temple
before Queen Elizabeth, the first three acts are stated to have
been written by T. Norton; the rest of the play (if not more)
was the work of T. Sackville, afterwards Lord Buckhurst and
earl of Dorset, whom Jasper Heywood praised for his sonnets,
but who is better known for his leading share in The <i>Mirror for
Magistrates</i>. Though the subject of <i>Gorboduc</i> is a British legend,
and though the action is neither copied nor adapted from any
treated by Seneca, yet the resemblance between this tragedy
and the <i>Thebais</i> is too strong to be fortuitous. In all formal
matters&mdash;chorus, messengers, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Gorboduc</i> adheres to the
usage of classical tragedy; but the authors show no respect for
the unities of time or place. Strong in construction, the tragedy
is&mdash;like its model, Seneca&mdash;weak in characterization. The
dialogue, it should be noticed, is in blank verse; and the device
of the <i>dumb-show</i>, in which the contents of each act are in succession
set forth in pantomime only, is employed at once to
instruct and to stimulate the spectator.</p>

<p>The nearly contemporary <i>Apius and Virginia</i> (c. 1563), though
it takes its subject&mdash;destined to become a perennial one on the
modern stage&mdash;from Roman story; the <i>Historie of Horestes</i> (pr.
1567); and T. Preston&rsquo;s <i>Cambises King of Percia</i> (1569-1570),
are somewhat rougher in form, and, the first and last of them at
all events, more violent in diction, than <i>Gorboduc</i>. They still
contain elements of the moralities (above all the Vice) and none
of the formal features of classical tragedy. But a <i>Julyus Sesyar</i>
seems to have been performed, in precisely the same circumstances
as <i>Gorboduc</i>, so early as 1562; and, four years later, G. Gascoigne,
the author of the satire <i>The Steele Glass</i>, produced with the aid
of two associates (F. Kinwelmersh and Sir Christopher Yelverton,
who wrote an epilogue), <i>Jocasta</i>, a virtual translation of L. Dolce&rsquo;s
<i>Giocasta</i>, which was an adaptation, probably, of R. Winter&rsquo;s
Latin translation of the <i>Phoenissae</i> of Euripides.<a name="fa163a" id="fa163a" href="#ft163a"><span class="sp">163</span></a> Between the
years 1567 and 1580 a large proportion of the plays presented at
court by choir- or school-boys, and by various companies of
actors, were taken from Greek legend or Roman history; as was
R. Edwardes&rsquo; <i>Damon and Pithias</i> (perhaps as early as 1564-1565),
which already shades off from tragedy into what soon came to
be called tragi-comedy.<a name="fa164a" id="fa164a" href="#ft164a"><span class="sp">164</span></a> Simultaneously with the influence,
exercised directly or indirectly, of classical literature, that of
Italian, both dramatic and narrative, with its marked tendency
to treat native themes, asserted itself, and, while diversifying
the current of early English tragedy, infused into it a long-abiding
element of passion. There are sufficient grounds for
concluding that a play on the subject of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, which
L. da Porto and M. Bandello had treated in prose narrative&mdash;that
of the latter having through a French version formed itself
into an English poem&mdash;was seen on an English stage in or before
1562. <i>Gismonde of Salerne</i>, a play founded on Boccaccio, was
acted before Queen Elizabeth at the Inner Temple in 1568,
nearly a generation before it was published, rewritten in blank
verse by R. Wilmot, one of the performers, then in holy orders;
G. Whetstone&rsquo;s <i>Promos and Cassandra</i>, founded on G. Cinthio
(from which came the plot of <i>Measure for Measure</i>), followed,
printed in 1578; and there were other &ldquo;casts of Italian devices&rdquo;
belonging to this age, in which the choice of a striking theme
still seemed the chief preoccupation of English tragic poets.</p>

<p>From the double danger which threatened English tragedy
in the days of its infancy&mdash;that it would congeal on the wintry
heights of classical themes, or dissolve its vigour in the glowing
heat of a passion fiercer than that of the Italians&mdash;<i>Ingleso
Italianato è un diavolo incarnato</i>&mdash;it was preserved more than by
any other cause by its happy association with the traditions of
the national history. An exceptional position might seem to be
in this respect occupied by T. Hughes&rsquo; interesting tragedy <i>The
Misfortunes of Arthur</i> (1587). But the author of this play&mdash;in
certain portions of whose framework there were associated with
him seven other members of Gray&rsquo;s Inn, including Francis Bacon,
and which was presented before Queen Elizabeth like <i>Gorboduc</i>&mdash;in
truth followed the example of the authors of that work both
in choice of theme, in details of form, and in a general though
far from servile imitation of the manner of Seneca; nor does he
represent any very material advance upon the first English
tragedy.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at the very time when from such beginnings
as those just described the English tragic drama was to set forth
upon a course in which it was to achieve so much, a
new sphere of activity suggested itself. And in this,
<span class="sidenote">Chronicle histories.</span>
after a few more or less tentative efforts, English
dramatists very speedily came to feel at home. In their direct
dramatization of passages or portions of English history (in
which the doings and sufferings of King Arthur could only by
courtesy or poetic licence be included) classical models would be
of scant service, while Italian examples of the treatment of
national historical subjects, having to deal with material so
wholly different, could not be followed with advantage. The
native species of the <i>chronicle history</i>, which designedly assumed
this name in order to make clear its origin and purpose, essayed
nothing more or less than a dramatic version of an existing
chronicle. Obviously, while the transition from half historical,
half epical narrative often implied carrying over into the new
form some of the features of the old, it was only when the subject
matter had been remoulded and recast that a true dramatic action
could result. But the <i>histories</i> to be found among the plays of
Shakespeare and one or two other Elizabethans are true dramas,
and it would be inconvenient to include these in the transitional
species of those known as <i>chronicle histories</i>. Among these ruder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page520" id="page520"></a>520</span>
compositions, which intermixed the blank verse introduced on
the Stage by <i>Gorboduc</i> with prose, and freely combined or placed
side by side tragic and comic ingredients, we have but few
distinct examples. One of these is <i>The Famous Victories of
Henry the Fifth</i>, known to have been acted before 1588; in
which both the verse and the prose are frequently of a very rude
sort, while it is neither divided into acts or scenes nor, in general,
constructed with any measure of dramatic skill. But its vigour
and freshness are considerable, and in many passages we recognize
familiar situations and favourite figures in later masterpieces of
the English historical drama. The second is <i>The Troublesome
Raigne of King John</i>, in two parts (printed in 1591), an epical
narrative transferred to the stage, neither a didactic effort like
Bale&rsquo;s, nor a living drama like Shakespeare&rsquo;s, but a far from
contemptible treatment of its historical theme. <i>The True
Chronicle History of King Leir</i> (acted in 1593) in form resembles
the above, though it is not properly on a national subject (its
story is taken from Geoffrey of Monmouth); but, with all its
defects, it seems only to await the touch of the master&rsquo;s hand to
become a tragedy of supreme effectiveness. A yet further step
was taken in the <i>Tragedy of Sir Thomas More</i> (c. 1590)&mdash;in
which Shakespeare&rsquo;s hand has been thought traceable, and
which deserves its designation of &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; not so much on
account of the relative nearness of the historical subject to the
date of its dramatic treatment, as because of the tragic responsibility
of character here already clearly worked out.</p>

<p>Such had been the beginnings of tragedy in England up to
the time when the genius of English dramatists was impelled
by the spirit that dominates a great creative epoch
of literature to seize the form ready to their hands.
<span class="sidenote">Earliest comedies.</span>
The birth of English comedy, at all times a process
of less labour and eased by an always ready popular responsiveness
to the most tentative efforts of art, had slightly preceded
that of her serious sister. As has been seen from the brief review
given above of the early history of the English academical
drama, isolated Latin comedies had been performed in the original
or in English versions as early as the reign of Henry VIII.&mdash;perhaps
even earlier; while the morality and its direct descendant,
the interlude, pointed the way towards popular treatment in the
vernacular of actions and characters equally well suited for the
diversion of Roman, Italian and English audiences. Thus
there was no innovation in the adaptation by N. Udal (<i>q.v.</i>) of
the <i>Miles Gloriosus</i> of Plautus under the title of <i>Ralph Roister
Doister</i>, which may claim to be the earliest extant English
comedy. It has a genuinely popular vein of humour, and the
names fit the characters after a fashion familiar to the moralities.
The second English comedy&mdash;in the opinion of at least one high
authority our first&mdash;is <i>Misogonus</i>, which was certainly written
as early as 1560. Its scene is laid in Italy; but the Vice, commonly
called &ldquo;Cacurgus,&rdquo; is both by himself and others frequently
designated as &ldquo;Will Summer,&rdquo; in allusion to Henry
VIII.&rsquo;s celebrated jester. <i>Gammer Gurton&rsquo;s Needle</i>, long regarded
as the earliest of all <i>English</i> comedies, was printed in 1575, as
acted &ldquo;not long ago in Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.&rdquo; Its
authorship was till recently attributed to John Still (afterwards
bishop of Bath and Wells), who was a resident M.A. at Christ&rsquo;s,
when a play was performed there in 1566. But the evidence of
his authorship is inconclusive, and the play &ldquo;made by Mr. S.,
Master of Arts,&rdquo; may be by William Stevenson, or by some other
contemporary. This comedy is slighter in plot and coarser in
diction than <i>Ralph Roister Doister</i>, but by no means unamusing.</p>

<p>In the main, however, early English comedy, while occasionally
introducing characters and scenes of thoroughly native origin
and complexion (<i>e.g.</i> Grim, the Collier of Croydon),<a name="fa165a" id="fa165a" href="#ft165a"><span class="sp">165</span></a> was content
to borrow its themes from classical or Italian sources.<a name="fa166a" id="fa166a" href="#ft166a"><span class="sp">166</span></a> G.
Gascoigne&rsquo;s <i>Supposes</i> (acted at Gray&rsquo;s Inn in 1566) is a translation
of <i>I Suppositi</i> of Ariosto, remarkable for the flowing facility of
its prose. While, on the one hand, the mixture of tragic with
comic motives, which was to become so distinctive a feature of the
Elizabethan drama, was already leading in the direction of tragi-comedy,
the precedent of the Italian pastoral drama encouraged
the introduction of figures and stories derived from classical
mythology; and the rapid and diversified influence of Italian
comedy, in close touch with Italian prose fiction, seemed likely
to affect and quicken continuously the growth of the lighter
branch of the English drama.</p>

<p>Out of such promises as these the glories of English drama
were ripened by the warmth and light of the great Elizabethan
age&mdash;of which the beginnings may fairly be reckoned
from the third decennium of the reign to which it owes
<span class="sidenote">Conditions of the early Elizabethan drama.</span>
its name. The queen&rsquo;s steady love of dramatic entertainments
could not of itself have led, though it undoubtedly
contributed, to such a result. Against the
attacks which a nascent puritanism was already directing
against the stage by the hands of J. Northbrooke,<a name="fa167a" id="fa167a" href="#ft167a"><span class="sp">167</span></a> the repentant
playwright S. Gosson,<a name="fa168a" id="fa168a" href="#ft168a"><span class="sp">168</span></a> P. Stubbes,<a name="fa169a" id="fa169a" href="#ft169a"><span class="sp">169</span></a> and others,<a name="fa170a" id="fa170a" href="#ft170a"><span class="sp">170</span></a> were to be set
not only the frugal favour of royalty and the more liberal
patronage of great nobles,<a name="fa171a" id="fa171a" href="#ft171a"><span class="sp">171</span></a> but the fact that literary authorities
were already weighing the endeavours of the English drama in
the balance of respectful criticism, and that in the abstract
at least the claims of both tragedy and comedy were upheld by
those who shrank from the desipience of idle pastimes. It is
noticeable that this period in the history of the English theatre
coincides with the beginning of the remarkable series of visits
made to Germany by companies of English comedians, which
did not come to an end till the period immediately before the
Thirty Years&rsquo; War, and were occasionally resumed after its close.
As at home the popularity of the stage increased, the functions
of playwright and actor, whether combined or not, began to
hold out a reasonable promise of personal gain. Nor, above all,
was that higher impulse which leads men of talent and genius
to attempt forms of art in harmony with the tastes and tendencies
of their times wanting to the group of writers who can be
remembered by no nobler name than that of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
predecessors.</p>

<p>The lives of all of these are, of course, in part contemporary
with the life of Shakespeare himself; nor was there any substantial
difference in the circumstances under which
most of them, and he, led their lives as dramatic
<span class="sidenote">The predecessors of Shakespeare.</span>
authors. A distinction was manifestly kept up
between poets and playwrights. Of the contempt
entertained for the actor&rsquo;s profession some fell to the share of
the dramatist; &ldquo;even Lodge,&rdquo; says C. M. Ingleby, &ldquo;who had
indeed never trod the stage, but had written several plays, and
had no reason to be ashamed of his antecedents, speaks of the
vocation of the play-maker as sharing the odium attaching to
the actor.&rdquo; Among the dramatists themselves good fellowship
and literary partnership only at times asserted themselves as
stronger than the tendency to mutual jealousy and abuse; of all
chapters of dramatic history, the annals of the early Elizabethan
stage perhaps least resemble those of Arcadia.</p>

<p>Moreover, the theatre had hardly found its strength as a
powerful element in the national life, when it was involved in
a bitter controversy, with which it had originally no
connexion, on behalf of an ally whose sympathy with
<span class="sidenote">History of the Elizabethan stage.</span>
it can only have been of a very limited kind. The
Marprelate controversy, into which, among leading
playwrights, Lyly and Nashe were drawn, in 1589 led to a stoppage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page521" id="page521"></a>521</span>
of stage-plays which proved only temporary; but the general
result of the attempt to make the stage a vehicle of political abuse
and invective was beyond a doubt to coarsen and degrade both
plays and players. Scurrilous attempts and rough repression
continued during the years 1590-1593; and the true remedy
was at last applied, when from about 1594, the chief London
actors became divided into two great rival companies&mdash;the lord
chamberlain&rsquo;s and the lord admiral&rsquo;s&mdash;which alone received
licences. Instead of half a dozen or more companies whose
jealousies communicated themselves to the playwrights belonging
to them, there were now, besides the Children of the Chapel, two
established bodies of actors, directed by steady and, in the full
sense of the word, respectable men. To the lord chamberlain&rsquo;s
company, which, after being settled at &ldquo;the Theater&rdquo; (opened as
early as 1576 or 1577), moved to Blackfriars, purchased by James
Burbage, in 1596, and to the Globe on the Bankside in 1599,
Shakespeare and Richard Burbage, the greatest of the Elizabethan
actors, belonged; the lord admiral&rsquo;s was managed by
Philip Henslowe, the author of the <i>Diary</i>, and Edward Alleyn,
the founder of Dulwich College, and was ultimately, in 1600,
settled at the Fortune. In these and other houses were performed
the plays of the Elizabethan dramatists, with few
adventitious aids, the performance being crowded into a brief
afternoon, when it is obvious that only the idler sections of the
population could attend. No woman might appear at a playhouse,
unless masked; on the stage, down to the Restoration,
women&rsquo;s parts continued to be acted by boys.</p>

<p>It is futile to take no account of such outward circumstances
as these and many which cannot here be noted in surveying the
progress of the literature of the Elizabethan drama. Like that
of the Restoration&mdash;and like that of the present day&mdash;it was
necessarily influenced in its method and spirit of treatment by
the conditions and restrictions which governed the place and
circumstances of the performance of plays, including the construction
of theatre and stage, as well as by the social composition
of its audiences, which the local accommodation, not less than
the entertainment, provided for them had to take into account.
But to these things a mere allusion must suffice. It may safely be
said, at the same time, that no dramatic literature which has
any claim to rank beside the Elizabethan&mdash;not that of Athens
nor those of modern Italy and Spain, nor those of France and
Germany in their classic periods&mdash;had to contend against such
odds; a mighty inherent strength alone ensured to it the vitality
which it so triumphantly asserted, and which enabled it to run
so unequalled a course.</p>

<p>Among Shakespeare&rsquo;s predecessors, John Lyly, whose plays
were all written for the Children of the Chapel and the Children
of St Paul&rsquo;s, holds a position apart in English dramatic
literature. The euphuism, to which his famous
<span class="sidenote">Lyly.</span>
romance gave its name, likewise distinguishes his mythological,<a name="fa172a" id="fa172a" href="#ft172a"><span class="sp">172</span></a>
quasi-historical,<a name="fa173a" id="fa173a" href="#ft173a"><span class="sp">173</span></a> allegorical,<a name="fa174a" id="fa174a" href="#ft174a"><span class="sp">174</span></a> and satirical<a name="fa175a" id="fa175a" href="#ft175a"><span class="sp">175</span></a> comedies. But his
real service to the progress of English drama is to be sought
neither in his choice of subjects nor in his imagery&mdash;though to
his fondness for fairylore and for the whole phantasmagoria of
legend, classical as well as romantic, his contemporaries, and
Shakespeare in particular, were indebted for a stimulative
precedent, and though in his <i>Endimion</i> at all events he excites
curiosity by an allegorical treatment of contemporary characters
and events. It does not even lie in the songs interspersed in his
plays, though none of his predecessors had in the slightest degree
anticipated the lyric grace which distinguishes some of these
incidental efforts. It consists in his adoption of Gascoigne&rsquo;s
innovation of writing plays in prose; and in his having, though
under the fetters of an affected and pretentious style, given the
first example of brisk and vivacious dialogue&mdash;an example to
<span class="sidenote">Kyd.</span>
which even such successors as Shakespeare and Jonson
were indebted. Thomas Kyd, the author of the
<i>Spanish Tragedy</i> (preceded or followed by the first part of
<i>Jeronimo</i>), and probably of several plays whose author was
unnamed, possesses some of the characteristics, but none of the
genius, of the greatest tragic dramatist who preceded Shakespeare.
<span class="sidenote">Marlowe.</span>
No slighter tribute than this is assuredly the
due of Christopher Marlowe, whose violent end prematurely
closed a poetic career of dazzling brilliancy. His
earliest play, <i>Tamburlaine the Great</i>, in which the use of blank
verse was introduced upon the English public stage, while full
of the &ldquo;high astounding terms&rdquo; of an extravagant and often
bombastic diction, is already marked by the passion which was
the poet&rsquo;s most characteristic feature, and which was to find
expression so luxuriantly beautiful in his <i>Doctor Faustus,</i> and
so surpassingly violent in his <i>Jew of Malta</i>. His masterpiece,
<i>Edward II.</i>, is a tragedy of singular pathos and of a dramatic
<span class="sidenote">Peele.</span>
power unapproached by any of his contemporaries.
George Peele was a far more versatile writer even as
a dramatist; but, though his plays contain passages of exquisite
beauty, not one of them is worthy to be ranked by the side of
Marlowe&rsquo;s <i>Edward II.</i>, compared with which, if indeed not
absolutely, Peele&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle of Edward I.</i> still stands on the
level of the species to which its title and character alike assign it.
His finest play is undoubtedly <i>David and Bethsabe</i>, which
resembles <i>Edward I.</i> in construction, but far surpasses it in
beauty of language and versification, besides treating its subject
with greatly superior dignity. If the difference between Peele
and Shakespeare is still, in many respects besides that of genius,
an immeasurable one, we seem to come into something like a
<span class="sidenote">Greene.</span>
Shakespearian atmosphere in more than one passage of
the plays of the unfortunate Robert Greene&mdash;unfortunate
perhaps in nothing more enduringly than in the proof
which he left behind him of his supercilious jealousy of Shakespeare.
Greene&rsquo;s genius, most conspicuous in plays treating
English life and scenes, could, notwithstanding his academic
self-sufficiency, at times free itself from the pedantry apt to
beset the flight of Peele&rsquo;s and at times even of Marlowe&rsquo;s muse;
and his most delightful work<a name="fa176a" id="fa176a" href="#ft176a"><span class="sp">176</span></a> seems to breathe something of the
air, sweet and fresh like no other, which blows over an English
countryside. Thomas Lodge, whose dramatic, and much less of
course his literary activity, is measured by the only play that we
know to have been wholly his;<a name="fa177a" id="fa177a" href="#ft177a"><span class="sp">177</span></a> Thomas Nashe, the redoubtable
pamphleteer and the father of the English picaresque novel;<a name="fa178a" id="fa178a" href="#ft178a"><span class="sp">178</span></a>
Henry Chettle, who worked the chords of both pity<a name="fa179a" id="fa179a" href="#ft179a"><span class="sp">179</span></a> and terror<a name="fa180a" id="fa180a" href="#ft180a"><span class="sp">180</span></a>
with equal vigour, and Anthony Munday, better remembered
for his city pageants than for his plays, are among the other
more important writers of the early Elizabethan drama, though
not all of them can strictly speaking be called predecessors of
Shakespeare. It is not possible here to enumerate the more
interesting of the anonymous plays which belong to this &ldquo;pre-Shakespearian&rdquo;
period of the Elizabethan drama; but many of
them are by intrinsic merit as well as for special causes deserving
of the attention of the student.</p>

<p>The common characteristics of nearly all these dramatists
and plays were in accordance with those of the great age to which
they belonged. Stirring times called for stirring
themes, such as those of &ldquo;Mahomet, Scipio and
<span class="sidenote">Common characteristics of the early Elizabethans.</span>
Tamerlane&rdquo;; and these again for a corresponding
vigour of treatment. Neatness and symmetry of
construction were neglected for fulness and variety
of matter. Novelty and grandeur of subject seemed
well matched by a swelling amplitude and often reckless extravagance
of diction. As if from an inner necessity, the balance
of rhymed couplets gave way to the impetuous march of blank
verse; &ldquo;strong lines&rdquo; were as inevitably called for as strong
situations and strong characters. Although the chief of these
poets are marked off from one another by the individual genius
which impressed itself upon both the form and the matter of
their works, yet the stamp of the age is upon them all. Writing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page522" id="page522"></a>522</span>
for the stage only, of which some of them possessed a personal
experience and from which none of them held aloof, they acquired
an instinctive insight into the laws of dramatic cause and effect,
and infused a warm vitality into the dramatic literature which
they produced, so to speak, for immediate consumption. On
the other hand, the same cause made rapidity of workmanship
indispensable to a successful playwright. <i>How</i> a play was
produced, how many hands had been at work upon it, what
loans and what spoliations had been made in the process, were
considerations of less moment than the question <i>whether</i> it was
produced, and whether it succeeded. His harness&mdash;frequently
double or triple&mdash;was inseparable from the lusty Pegasus of the
early English drama, and its genius toiled, to borrow the phrase
of the Attic comedian, &ldquo;like an Arcadian mercenary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This period of the English drama, though it is far from being
one of crude effort, could not therefore yet be one of full consummation.
In tragedy the advance which had been
made in the choice of great themes, in knitting closer
<span class="sidenote">Progress of tragedy and comedy before Shakespeare.</span>
the connection between the theatre and the national
history, in vindicating to passion its right to adequate
expression, was already enormous. In comedy the
advance had been less decisive and less independent;
much had been gained in reaching greater freedom
of form and something in enlarging the range of subjects; but
artificiality had proved a snare in the one direction, while the
licence of the comic stage, upheld by favourite &ldquo;clowns,&rdquo; such
as Kemp or Tarlton, had not succumbed before less elastic
demands. The way of escaping from the dilemma had, however,
been already recognized to lie in the construction of suitable
plots, for which a full storehouse was open in the popular traditions
preserved in national ballads, and in the growing literature
of translated foreign fiction, or of native imitations of it. Meanwhile,
the aberration of the comic stage to political and religious
controversy, which it could never hope to treat with Attic
freedom in a country provided with a strong monarchy and a
dogmatic religion, seemed likely to extinguish the promise of
the beginnings of English romantic comedy.</p>

<p>These were the circumstances under which the greatest of
dramatists began to devote his genius to the theatre. Shakespeare&rsquo;s
career as a writer of plays can have differed
little in its beginnings from those of his contemporaries
<span class="sidenote">Shakespeare.</span>
and rivals. Before or while he was proceeding from the
re-touching and re-writing of the plays of others to original
dramatic composition, the most gifted of those whom we have
termed his predecessors had passed away. He had been decried
as an actor before he was known as an author; and after living
through days of darkness for the theatre, if not for himself,
attained, before the close of the century, to the beginnings of his
prosperity and the beginnings of his fame. But if we call him
fortunate, it is not because of such rewards as these. As a poet,
Shakespeare was no doubt happy in his times, which intensified
the strength of the national character, expanded the activities
of the national mind, and were able to add their stimulus even
to such a creative power as his. He was happy in the antecedents
of the form of literature which commended itself to his choice,
and in the opportunities which it offered in so many directions
for an advance to heights yet undiscovered and unknown.
What he actually accomplished was due to his genius, whose
achievements are immeasurable like itself. His influence upon
the progress of English drama divides itself in very unequal
proportions into a direct and an indirect influence. To the
former alone reference can here be made.</p>

<p>Already the first editors of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works in a collected
form recognized so marked a distinction between his plays
taken from English history and those treating other
historical subjects (whether ancient or modern) that,
<span class="sidenote">Shakespeare and the national historical drama.</span>
while they included the latter among the tragedies at
large, they grouped the former as <i>histories</i> by themselves.
These <i>histories</i> are in their literary genesis a
development of the <i>chronicle histories</i> of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
predecessors and contemporaries, the taste for which had greatly
increased towards the beginning of his own career as a dramatist,
in accordance with the general progress of national life and
sentiment in this epoch. Though it cannot be assumed that
Shakespeare composed his several dramas from English history
in the sequence of the chronology of their themes, his genius
gave to the entire series an inner harmony, and a continuity
corresponding to that which is distinctive of the national life,
such as not unnaturally inspired certain commentators with
the wish to prove it a symmetrically constructed whole. He
thus brought this peculiarly national species to a perfection
which made it difficult, if not impossible, for his later contemporaries
and successors to make more than an occasional
addition to his series. None of them was, however, found able
or ready to take up the thread where Shakespeare had left it,
after perfunctorily attaching the present to the past by a work
(probably not all his own) which must be regarded as the end
rather than the crown of the series of his <i>histories</i>.<a name="fa181a" id="fa181a" href="#ft181a"><span class="sp">181</span></a> But to furnish
such supplements accorded little with the tastes and tendencies
of the later Elizabethans; and with the exception of an isolated
work,<a name="fa182a" id="fa182a" href="#ft182a"><span class="sp">182</span></a> the national historical drama in Shakespeare reached at
once its perfection and its close. The ruder form of the old
chronicle history for a time survived the advance made upon it;
but the efforts in this field of T. Heywood,<a name="fa183a" id="fa183a" href="#ft183a"><span class="sp">183</span></a> S. Rowley,<a name="fa184a" id="fa184a" href="#ft184a"><span class="sp">184</span></a> and others
are, from a literary point of view, anachronisms.</p>

<p>Of Shakespeare&rsquo;s other plays the several groups exercised
a more direct influence upon the general progress of our dramatic
literature. His Roman tragedies, though following their
authorities with much the same fidelity as that of the English
<i>histories</i>, even more effectively taught the great lesson of free
dramatic treatment of historic themes, and thus pre-eminently
became the perennial models of the modern historic drama. His
tragedies on other subjects, which necessarily admitted of a more
absolute freedom of treatment, established themselves as the
examples for all time of the highest kind of tragedy. Where else
is exhibited with the same fulness the struggle between will and
obstacle, character and circumstance? Where is mirrored
with equal power and variety the working of those passions in
the mastery of which over man lies his doom? Here, above all,
Shakespeare as compared with his predecessors, as well as with
his successors, &ldquo;<i>is</i> that nature which they paint and draw.&rdquo;
He threw open to modern tragedy a range of hitherto unknown
breadth and depth and height, and emancipated the national
drama in its noblest forms from limits to which it could never
again restrict itself without a consciousness of having renounced
its enfranchisement. Happily for the variety of his creative
genius on the English stage, no divorce had been proclaimed
between the serious and the comic, and no division of species
had been established such as he himself ridicules as pedantic
when it professes to be exhaustive. The comedies of Shakespeare
accordingly refuse to be tabulated in deference to any method
of classification deserving to be called precise; and several of
them are comedies only according to a purely technical use of
the term. In those in which the instinct of reader or spectator
recognizes the comic interest to be supreme, it is still of its nature
incidental to the progress of the action; for the criticism seems
just, as well as in agreement with what we can conclude as to
Shakespeare&rsquo;s process of construction, that among all his comedies
not more than a single one<a name="fa185a" id="fa185a" href="#ft185a"><span class="sp">185</span></a> is in both design and effect a comedy
of character proper. Thus in this direction, while the unparalleled
wealth of his invention renewed or created a whole
gallery of types, he left much to be done by his successors;
while the truest secrets of his comic art, which interweaves fancy
with observation, draws wisdom from the lips of fools, and
imbues with character what all other hands would have left
shadowy, monstrous or trivial, are among the things inimitable
belonging to the individuality of his poetic genius.</p>

<p>The influences of Shakespeare&rsquo;s diction and versification upon
those of the English drama in general can hardly be overrated,
though it would be next to impossible to state them definitely. In
these points, Shakespeare&rsquo;s manner as a writer was progressive;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page523" id="page523"></a>523</span>
and this progress has been deemed sufficiently well traceable
in his plays to be used as an aid in seeking to determine
<span class="sidenote">His style and its influence.</span>
their chronological sequence. The general laws of this
progress accord with those of the natural advance of
creative genius; artificiality gives way to freedom,
and freedom in its turn submits to a greater degree
of regularity and care. In versification as in diction the
earliest and the latest period of Shakespeare&rsquo;s dramatic writing
are more easily recognizable than what lies between and may be
called the <i>normal</i> period, the plays belonging to which in form
most resemble one another, and are least affected by distinguishable
peculiarities&mdash;such as the rhymes and intentionally euphuistic
colouring of style which characterize the earliest, or the feminine
endings of the lines and the more condensed manner of expression
common to the latest of his plays. But, such distinctions apart,
there can be no doubt but that in verse and in prose alike, Shakespeare&rsquo;s
style, so far as it admitted of reproduction, is itself to be
regarded as the <i>norm</i> of that of the Elizabethan drama; that
in it the prose form of English comedy possesses its first accepted
model; and that in it the chosen metre of the English versified
drama established itself as irremovable unless at the risk of an
artificial experiment.</p>

<p>The assertion may seem paradoxical, that it is by their construction
that Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays exerted the most palpable
influence upon the English drama, as well as upon the
modern drama of the Germanic nations in general,
<span class="sidenote">Influence of his method of construction.</span>
and upon such forms of the Romance drama as have
been in more recent times based upon it. For it was
not in construction that his greatest strength lay,
or that the individuality of his genius could raise him above the
conditions under which he worked in common with his immediate
predecessors and contemporaries. Yet the fact that he accepted
these conditions, while producing works of matchless strength
and of unequalled fidelity to the demands of nature and art,
established them as inseparable from the Shakespearian drama&mdash;to
use a term which is perhaps unavoidable but has been often
misapplied. The great and irresistible demand on the part of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s public was for <i>incident</i>&mdash;a demand which of itself
necessitated a method of construction different from that of the
Greek drama, or of those modelled more or less closely upon it.
To no other reason is to be ascribed the circumstance that Shakespeare
so constantly combined two actions in the course of a
single play, not merely supplementing the one by means of the
other as a bye- or under-plot. In no respect is the progress of
his technical skill as a dramatist more apparent,&mdash;a proposition
which a comparison of plays clearly ascribable to successive
periods of his life must be left to prove.</p>

<p>Should it, however, be sought to express in one word the
greatest debt of the drama to Shakespeare, this word must be
the same as that which expresses his supreme gift as
a dramatist. It is in <i>characterization</i>&mdash;in the drawing
<span class="sidenote">His characters.</span>
of characters ranging through almost every type of
humanity which furnishes a fit subject for the tragic or the comic
art&mdash;that he remains absolutely unapproached; and it was in
this direction that he pointed the way which the English drama
could not henceforth desert without becoming untrue to itself.
It may have been a mere error of judgment which afterwards
held him to have been surpassed by others in particular fields
of characterization (setting him down, forsooth, as supremely
excellent in male, but not in female, characters). But it was a
sure sign of decay when English writers began to shrink from
following him in the endeavour to make the drama a mirror
of humanity, and when, in self-condemned arrogance, they
thrust unreality back upon a stage which he had animated with
the warm breath of life, where Juliet had blossomed like a
flower of spring, and where Othello&rsquo;s noble nature had suffered
and sinned.</p>

<p>By the numerous body of poets who, contemporary with
Shakespeare or in the next generation, cultivated the wide field
of the national drama, every form commending itself to the
tastes and sympathies of the national genius was essayed. None
were neglected except those from which the spirit of English
literature had been estranged by the Reformation, and those
which had from the first been artificial importations of the
<span class="sidenote">Forms of the later Elizabethan drama.</span>
Renaissance. The mystery could not in England, as in
Spain, produce such an aftergrowth as the <i>auto</i>, and the
confines of the religious drama were only now and then
tentatively touched.<a name="fa186a" id="fa186a" href="#ft186a"><span class="sp">186</span></a> The direct imitations of classical
examples were, except perhaps in the continued efforts
of the academical drama, few and feeble. Chapman, while
resorting to use of narrative in tragedy and perhaps otherwise
indebted to ancient models, was no follower of them in essentials.
S. Daniel (1562-1619) may be regarded as a belated disciple of
Seneca,<a name="fa187a" id="fa187a" href="#ft187a"><span class="sp">187</span></a> while experiments like W. Alexander&rsquo;s (afterwards earl
of Stirling) <i>Monarchicke Tragedies</i><a name="fa188a" id="fa188a" href="#ft188a"><span class="sp">188</span></a> (1603-1605) are the mere
isolated efforts of a student, and more exclusively so than
Milton&rsquo;s imposing <i>Samson Agonistes</i>, which belongs to a later
date (1677). At the opposite end of the dramatic scale, the light
gaiety of the Italian and French farce could not establish itself
on the English popular stage without more substantial adjuncts;
the Englishman&rsquo;s festive digestion long continued robust, and
<span class="sidenote">The pastoral drama.</span>
he liked his amusements solid. In the pastoral drama
and the mask, however, many English dramatists
found special opportunities for the exercise of their
lyrical gifts and of their inventive powers. The former
could never become other than an exotic, so long as it retained
the artificial character of its origin. Shakespeare had accordingly
only blended elements derived from it into the action of
his romantic comedies. In more or less isolated works Jonson,
Fletcher, Daniel, Randolph, and others sought to rival Tasso
and Guarini&mdash;Jonson<a name="fa189a" id="fa189a" href="#ft189a"><span class="sp">189</span></a> coming nearest to nationalizing an
essentially foreign growth by the fresh simplicity of his treatment,
Fletcher<a name="fa190a" id="fa190a" href="#ft190a"><span class="sp">190</span></a> bearing away the palm for beauty of poetic execution;
Daniel being distinguished by simpler beauties of style in both
verse and prose.<a name="fa191a" id="fa191a" href="#ft191a"><span class="sp">191</span></a></p>

<p>The mask (or masque) was a more elastic kind of composition,
mixing in varying proportions its constituent elements of
declamation and dialogue, music and dancing, decoration
and scenery. In its least elaborate literary form&mdash;which,
<span class="sidenote">The mask.</span>
of course, externally was the most elaborate&mdash;it closely
approached the pageant; in other instances the distinctness of
its characters or the fulness of the action introduced into its
scheme, brought it nearer to the regular drama. A frequent
ornament of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s progresses, it was cultivated with
increased assiduity in the reign of James I., and in that of his
successor outshone, by the favour it enjoyed with court and
nobility, the attractions of the regular drama itself. Most of
the later Elizabethan dramatists contributed to this species,
upon which Shakespeare expended the resources of his fancy
only incidentally in the course of his dramas; but by far the
most successful writer of masks was Ben Jonson, of whose
numerous compositions of this kind many hold a permanent
place in English poetic literature, and &ldquo;next&rdquo; whom, in his
own judgment, &ldquo;only Fletcher and Chapman could write a
mask.&rdquo; From a poetic point of view, however, they were at least
rivalled by Dekker and Ford; in productivity and favour T.
Campion, who was equally eminent as poet and as musician,
seems for a time to have excelled. Inasmuch, however, as the
history of the mask in England is to a great extent that of
&ldquo;painting and carpentry&rdquo; and of Inigo Jones, and as, moreover,
this kind of piece, while admitting dramatic elements,
is of its nature occasional, it need not further be pursued here.
The <i>Microcosmus</i> of T. Nabbes (printed 1637), which is very
like a morality, seems to have been the first mask brought
upon the public stage. It was the performance of a mask by
Queen Henrietta Maria and her ladies at Whitehall which had
some years previously (1632) been thought to have supplied
to the invective of <i>Histrio-Mastix</i> against the stage the occasion
for disloyal innuendo; and it was for the performance of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page524" id="page524"></a>524</span>
mask in a great nobleman&rsquo;s castle that Milton&mdash;a Puritan of a
very different cast&mdash;not long afterwards (1634) wrote one of
the loftiest and loveliest of English poems. <i>Comus</i> has been
judged and condemned as a drama&mdash;unjustly, for the dramatic
qualities of a mask are not essential to it as a species. Yet its
history in England remains inseparably connected with that
of the Elizabethan drama. In later times the mask merged
into the opera, or continued a humble life of its own apart
from contact with higher literary effort. It is strange that later
English poets should have done so little to restore to its nobler
uses, and to invest with a new significance, a form so capable of
further development as the poetic mask.</p>

<p>The annals of English drama proper in the period reaching
from the closing years of Elizabeth to the outbreak of the
great Revolution include, together with numerous
names relatively insignificant, many illustrious in the
<span class="sidenote">The later Elizabethan drama.</span>
history of our poetic literature. Among Shakespeare&rsquo;s
contemporaries and successors there is, however, but
one who by the energy of his genius, not less than by the circumstances
of his literary career, reached undisputed primacy
among his fellows. Ben Jonson, to whom in his latter days a
whole generation of younger writers did filial homage as to their
veteran chief, was alone in full truth the founder of a school
or family of dramatists. Yet his pre-eminence did not (whatever
he or his followers may have thought) extend to both branches
of the regular drama. In tragedy he fell short of the highest
success; the weight of his learning lay too heavily upon his
efforts to draw from deeper sources than those which had
sufficed for Shakespeare. Such as they are, his tragic works<a name="fa192a" id="fa192a" href="#ft192a"><span class="sp">192</span></a>
stand almost, though not quite, alone in this period as examples
of sustained effort in historic tragedy proper. G. Chapman
treated stirring themes, more especially from modern French
history,<a name="fa193a" id="fa193a" href="#ft193a"><span class="sp">193</span></a> always with vigour, and at times with genuine effectiveness;
but, though rich in beauties of detail, he failed in this
branch of the drama to follow Shakespeare even at a distance in
the supreme art of fully developing a character by means of
the action. Mention has been made above of Ford&rsquo;s isolated
effort in the direction of historic tragedy, as well as of excursions
into the still popular domain of the chronicle history by T.
Heywood, Dekker and others, which cannot be regarded as
anything more than retrogressions. With the great body of the
English dramatists of this and of the next period, tragedy had
passed into a phase where its interest depended mainly upon plot
and incident. The romantic tragedies and tragi-comedies which
crowd English literature in this period constitute together a
growth of at first sight astonishing exuberance, and in mere
externals of theme&mdash;ranging as these plays do from Byzantium
to ancient Britain, and from the Caesars of ancient Rome to
the tyrants of the Renaissance&mdash;of equally astonishing variety.
The sources from which these subjects were derived had been
perennially augmenting. Besides Italian, Spanish and French
fiction, original or translated, besides British legend in its
Romance dress, and English fiction in its humbler or in its more
ambitious and artificial forms, the contemporary foreign drama,
especially the Spanish, offered opportunities for resort. To the
English, as to the French and Italian drama, of both this and the
following century, the prolific dramatists clustering round Lope
de Vega and Calderon, and the native or naturalized fictions from
which they drew their materials supplied a whole arsenal of
plots, incidents and situations&mdash;among others to Middleton, to
Webster, and most signally to Beaumont and Fletcher. And, in
addition to these resources, a new field of supply was at hand
since English dramatists had begun to regard events and episodes
of domestic life as fit subjects for tragic treatment. Domestic
tragedy of this description was indeed no novelty on the English
stage; Shakespeare himself may have retouched with his master-hand
more than one effort of this kind;<a name="fa194a" id="fa194a" href="#ft194a"><span class="sp">194</span></a> but T. Heywood may
be set down as the first who achieved any work of considerable
literary value of this class,<a name="fa195a" id="fa195a" href="#ft195a"><span class="sp">195</span></a> to which some of the plays of T.
Dekker, T. Middleton, and others likewise more or less belong.
Yet, in contrast to this wide variety of sources, and consequent
apparent variety of themes, the number of <i>motives</i> employed&mdash;at
least as a rule&mdash;in the tragic drama of this period was comparatively
small and limited. Hence it is that, notwithstanding
the diversity of subjects among the tragic dramas of such
writers as Marston, Webster, Fletcher, Ford and Shirley, an
impression of sameness is left upon us by a connected perusal
of these works. Scheming ambition, conjugal jealousy, absolute
female devotion, unbridled masculine passion&mdash;such are the
motives which constantly recur in the Decameron of our later
Elizabethan drama. And this impression is heightened by the
want of moderation, by the extravagance of passion, which these
dramatists so habitually exhibit in the treatment of their
favourite themes. All the tragic poets of this period are not
equally amenable to this charge; in J. Webster,<a name="fa196a" id="fa196a" href="#ft196a"><span class="sp">196</span></a> master as he
is of the effects of the horrible, and in J. Ford,<a name="fa197a" id="fa197a" href="#ft197a"><span class="sp">197</span></a> surpassingly
seductive in his sweetness, the monotony of exaggerated passion
is broken by those marvellously sudden and subtle touches
through which their tragic genius creates its most thrilling effects.
Nor will the tendency to excess of passion which F. Beaumont
and J. Fletcher undoubtedly exhibit be confounded with their
distinctive power of sustaining tenderly pathetic characters and
irresistibly moving situations in a degree unequalled by any of
their contemporaries&mdash;a power seconded by a beauty of diction
and softness of versification which for a time raised them to the
highest pinnacle of popular esteem, and which entitles them in
their conjunction, and Fletcher as an independent worker, to
an enduring pre-eminence among their fellows. In their morals
Beaumont and Fletcher are not above the level of their age.
The manliness of sentiment and occasionally greater width of
outlook which ennoble the rhetorical genius of P. Massinger,
and the gift of poetic illustration which entitles J. Shirley to be
remembered not merely as the latest and the most fertile of this
group of dramatists, have less direct bearing upon the general
character of the tragic art of the period. The common features
of the romantic tragedy of this age are sufficiently marked;
but they leave unobscured the distinctive features in its individual
writers of which a discerning criticism has been able to take note.</p>

<p>In comedy, on the other hand, the genius and the insight of
Jonson pointed the way to a steady and legitimate advance.
His theory of &ldquo;humours&rdquo; (which found the most palpable
expression in two of his earliest plays<a name="fa198a" id="fa198a" href="#ft198a"><span class="sp">198</span></a>), if translated into the
ordinary language of dramatic art, signifies the paramount
importance in the comic drama of the presentation of distinctive
human types. As such it survived by name into the Restoration
age<a name="fa199a" id="fa199a" href="#ft199a"><span class="sp">199</span></a> and cannot be said to have ever died out. In the actual
reproduction of humanity in its infinite but never, in his hands,
alien variety, it was impossible that Shakespeare should be
excelled by Jonson; but in the consciousness with which he
recognized and indicated the highest sphere of a comic dramatist&rsquo;s
labours, he rendered to the drama a direct service which the
greater master had left unperformed. By the rest of his contemporaries
and his successors, some of whom, such as R. Brome,
were content avowedly to follow in his footsteps, Jonson was
only occasionally rivalled in individual instances of comic
creations; in the entirety of its achievements his genius as a
comic dramatist remained unapproached. The favourite types
of Jonsonian comedy, to which Dekker, J. Marston and Chapman
had, though to no large extent, added others of their own, were
elaborated with incessant zeal and remarkable effect by their
contemporaries and successors. It was after a very different
fashion from that in which the Roman comedians reiterated
the ordinary types of the New Attic comedy, that the inexhaustible
<i>verve</i> of T. Middleton, the buoyant productivity of
Fletcher, the observant humour of N. Field, and the artistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page525" id="page525"></a>525</span>
versatility of Shirley&mdash;not to mention many later and not
necessarily minor names<a name="fa200a" id="fa200a" href="#ft200a"><span class="sp">200</span></a>&mdash;mirrored in innumerable pictures of
contemporary life the undying follies and foibles of mankind.
As comedians of manners more than one of these surpassed the
old master, not indeed in distinctness and correctness&mdash;the
fruits of the most painstaking genius that ever fitted a learned
sock to the representation of the living realities of life&mdash;but in a
lightness not incompatible with sureness of touch; while in the
construction of plots the access of abundant new materials,
and the greater elasticity in treatment resulting from accumulated
experience, enabled them to advance from success to success.
Thus the comic dramatic literature from Jonson to Shirley is
unsurpassed as a comedy of manners, while as a comedy of
character it at least defies comparison with any other national
literary growth preceding or contemporaneous with it. Though
the younger generation, of which W. Cartwright may be taken
as an example, was unequal in originality or force to its predecessors,
yet so little exhausted was the vitality of the species,
that its traditions survived the <i>interregnum</i> of the Revolution,
and connected themselves more closely than is sometimes assumed
with later growths of English comedy.</p>

<p>Such was also the case with a special growth which had
continued side by side, but in growing frequency of contact,
with the progress of the national drama. The
academical drama of the later Elizabethan period and
<span class="sidenote">The later academical drama.</span>
of the first two Stuart reigns by no means fell off
either in activity or in variety from that of the preceding
generations. At Oxford, after an apparent break of several
years&mdash;though in the course of these one or two new plays,
including a <i>Tancred</i> by Sir Henry Wotton at Queen&rsquo;s, seem to
have been produced&mdash;a long succession of English plays, some
in Latin doubtless from time to time intervening, were performed,
from the early years of the 17th century onwards to the dark
days of the national theatre and beyond. The production of
these plays was distributed among several colleges, among
which the most conspicuously active were Christ Church and
St John&rsquo;s, where a whole series of festal performances took
place under the collective title of <i>The Christmas Prince</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
master of the Christmas revels). They included a wide variety
of pieces, from the treatment by an author unnamed of the story
of &ldquo;Ovid&rsquo;s owne Narcissus&rdquo; (1602) and S. Daniel&rsquo;s <i>Queen&rsquo;s
Arcadia</i> (1606) to Barten Holiday&rsquo;s <i>Technogamia</i> (1618), a
complicated allegory on the relations between the arts and
sciences quite in the manner of the moralities; interspersed by
romantic dramas of the ordinary contemporary type by T. Goffe
(1591-1629), W. Cartwright, J. Maine (1604-1672) and others.
At Cambridge the list of Latin and English academical plays,
performed in the latter half of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign at Trinity,
St John&rsquo;s, Queen&rsquo;s and a few other colleges, contains several
examples in each language which for one reason or another possess
a special interest. Thus E. Forsett&rsquo;s <i>Pedantius</i>, probably acted
at Trinity in 1581, ridicules a personage who lived very near the
rose&mdash;the redoubtable Gabriel Harvey;<a name="fa201a" id="fa201a" href="#ft201a"><span class="sp">201</span></a> a <i>Laelia</i>, acted at
Queen&rsquo;s in 1590 and again in 1598, resembles <i>Twelfth Night</i>
in part of its plot; while in <i>Silvanus</i>, performed in 1596, probably
at St John&rsquo;s, there are certain striking similarities to <i>As You
Like It</i>. These are in Latin, as are the comedies <i>Hispanus</i>
(containing some curious allusions to the Armada, Drake and
Dr Lopez) and <i>Machiavellus</i>, acted at St John&rsquo;s in 1597.<a name="fa202a" id="fa202a" href="#ft202a"><span class="sp">202</span></a> By
far the most interesting of the English plays of the later Cambridge
series, and, it may be averred, of the remains of the English
academical drama as a whole, are the Parnassus Plays (<i>q.v.</i>),
successively produced at St John&rsquo;s in 1598-1602, which illustrate
with much truthfulness as well as fancy the relations between
university life and the outside world, including the world of
letters and of the stage. Upon a different, but also a very
notable, aspect of English university life&mdash;the relations between
town and gown&mdash;a partisan light is thrown by <i>Club-Law</i>, acted
at Clare in 1599&mdash;and in G. Ruggle&rsquo;s celebrated Latin comedy of
<i>Ignoramus</i>, twice acted by members of Clare at Trinity in 1615
before King James I. On one of these occasions were also produced
in English T. Tomkis&rsquo; comedy <i>Albumazar</i> (a play absurdly
attributed to Shakespeare), and Phineas Fletcher&rsquo;s <i>Sicelides</i>, a
&ldquo;piscatory&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> a pastoral drama in which the place of the
shepherds is taken by fishermen). Latin and English plays
continued to be brought out in Cambridge till the year of the
outbreak of the Civil War, T. Randolph and A. Cowley<a name="fa203a" id="fa203a" href="#ft203a"><span class="sp">203</span></a> being
among the authors of some of the latest so produced; and with
the Restoration the usage recommenced, the <i>Adelphi</i> of Terence
and other Latin comedies being performed as they had been
a century earlier. A complete survey and classification of the
English academical drama, for which the materials are at last
being collected and compared, will prove of an importance which
is only beginning to be recognized to the future historian of the
English drama.</p>

<p>To return to the general current of that drama. The rivals
against which it had to contend in the times with which its
greatest epoch came to an end have in their turn been
noticed. From the masks and triumphs at court and
<span class="sidenote">The stage.</span>
at the houses of the nobility, with their Olympuses and Parnassuses
built by Inigo Jones, and filled with goddesses and
nymphs clad in the gorgeous costumes designed by his inventive
hand, to the city pageants and shows by land and water&mdash;from
the tilts and tournaments at Whitehall to the more philosophical
devices at the Inns of Court and the academical plays at the
universities&mdash;down even to the brief but thrilling theatrical
excitements of Bartholomew Fair and the &ldquo;Ninevitical motions&rdquo;
of the puppets&mdash;in all these ways the various sections of the
theatrical public were tempted aside. Foreign performers&mdash;French
and Spanish actors, and even French actresses&mdash;paid
visits to London. But the national drama held its ground.
The art of acting maintained itself at least on the level to which it
had been brought by Shakespeare&rsquo;s associates and contemporaries,
Burbage and Heminge, Alleyn, Lewin, Taylor, and others &ldquo;of
the older sort.&rdquo; The profession of actor came to be more generally
than of old separated from that of playwright, though they
were still (as in the case of Field) occasionally combined. But
this rather led to an increased appreciation of the artistic merit
of actors who valued the dignity of their own profession and
whose co-operation the authors learnt to esteem as of independent
significance. The stage was purged from the barbarism of the
old school of clowns. Women&rsquo;s parts were still acted by boys,
many of whom attained to considerable celebrity; and a practice
was thus continued which must assuredly have placed the English
theatre at a considerable disadvantage as compared with the
Spanish (where it never obtained), and which may, while it has
been held to have facilitated freedom of fancy, more certainly
encouraged the extreme licence of expression cherished by the
dramatists. The arrangement of the stage, which facilitated a
rapid succession of scenes without any necessity for their being
organically connected with one another, remained essentially
what it had been in Shakespeare&rsquo;s days; though the primitive
expedients for indicating locality had begun to be occasionally
exchanged for scenery more or less appropriate to the place of
action. Costume was apparently cultivated with much greater
care; and the English stage of this period had probably gone a
not inconsiderable way in a direction to which it is obviously
in the interests of the dramatic art to set some bounds, if it
is to depend for its popular success upon its qualities as such,
and upon the interpretation of its agents upon the stage. At
the same time, the drama had begun largely to avail itself of
adventitious aids to favour. The system of prologues and
epilogues, and of dedications to published plays, was more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page526" id="page526"></a>526</span>
uniformly employed than it had been by Shakespeare as the
conventional method of recommending authors and actors to the
favour of individual patrons, and to that of their chief patron,
the public.</p>

<p>Up to the outbreak of the Civil War the drama in all its
forms continued to enjoy the favour or good-will of the court,
although a close supervision was exercised over all
attempts to make the stage the vehicle of political
<span class="sidenote">The drama and Puritanism.</span>
references or allusions. The regular official agent of
this supervision was the master of the revels; but
under James I. a special ordinance, in harmony with the king&rsquo;s
ideas concerning the dignity of the throne, was passed &ldquo;against
representing any modern Christian king in plays on the stage.&rdquo;
The theatre could hardly expect to be allowed a liberty of speech
in reference to matters of state denied to the public at large;
and occasional attempts to indulge in the freedom of criticism
dear to the spirit of comedy met with more or less decisive
repression and punishment.<a name="fa204a" id="fa204a" href="#ft204a"><span class="sp">204</span></a> But the sympathies of the
dramatists were so entirely on the side of the court that the real
difficulties against which the theatre had to contend came from
a directly opposite quarter. With the growth of Puritanism
the feeling of hostility to the stage increased in a large part
of the population, well represented by the civic authorities of the
capital. This hostility found many ways of expressing itself.
The attempts to suppress the Blackfriars theatre (1619, 1631,
1633) proved abortive; but the representation of stage-plays
continued to be prohibited on Sundays, and during the prevalence
of the plague in London in 1637 was temporarily suspended
altogether. The desire of the Puritans of the more pronounced
type openly aimed at a permanent closing of the theatres.
The war between them and the dramatists was accordingly of a
life-and-death kind. On the one hand, the drama heaped its
bitterest and often coarsest attacks upon whatever savoured
of the Puritan spirit; gibes, taunts, caricatures in ridicule
and aspersion of Puritans and Puritanism make up a great part
of the comic literature of the later Elizabethan drama and of its
aftergrowth in the reigns of the first two Stuarts. This feeling
of hostility, to which Shakespeare was no stranger,<a name="fa205a" id="fa205a" href="#ft205a"><span class="sp">205</span></a> though he
cannot be connected with the authorship of one of its earliest
and coarsest expressions,<a name="fa206a" id="fa206a" href="#ft206a"><span class="sp">206</span></a> rose into a spirit of open defiance in
some of the masterpieces of Ben Jonson;<a name="fa207a" id="fa207a" href="#ft207a"><span class="sp">207</span></a> and the comedies of
his contemporaries and successors<a name="fa208a" id="fa208a" href="#ft208a"><span class="sp">208</span></a> abound in caricatured reproductions
of the more common or more extravagant types of
Puritan life. On the other hand, the moral defects, the looseness
of tone, the mockery of ties sanctioned by law and consecrated
by religion, the tendency to treat middle-class life as the hunting-ground
for the diversions of the upper classes, which degraded
so much of the dramatic literature of the age, intensified the
Puritan opposition to all and any stage plays. A patient endeavour
to reform instead of suppressing the drama was not to
be looked for from such adversaries, should they ever possess
the means of carrying out their views; and whenever Puritanism
should victoriously assert itself in the state, the stage was
doomed. Among the attacks directed against it in its careless
heyday of prosperity Prynne&rsquo;s <i>Histrio-Mastix</i> (1632), while it
involved its author in shamefully cruel persecution, did not
remain wholly without effect upon the tone of the dramatic
literature of the subsequent period; but the quarrel between
Puritanism and the theatre was too old and too deep to end in
any but one way, so soon as the latter was deprived of its
<span class="sidenote">Closing of the theatres.</span>
protectors. The Civil War began in August 1642;
and early in the following month was published the
ordinance of the Lords and Commons, which, after a
brief and solemn preamble, commanded &ldquo;that while
these sad causes and set-times of humiliation do continue,
public stage plays shall cease and be forborne.&rdquo; Many actors
and playwrights followed the fortunes of the royal cause in the
field; some may have gone into a more or less voluntary exile;
upon those who lingered on in the familiar haunts the hand of
power lay heavy; and, though there seems reason to believe
that dramatic entertainments of one kind or another continued
to be occasionally presented, stringent ordinances gave summary
powers to magistrates against any players found engaged in
such proceedings (1647), and bade them treat all stage-players
as rogues, and pull down all stage galleries, seats and boxes
(1648). A few dramatic works were published in this period;<a name="fa209a" id="fa209a" href="#ft209a"><span class="sp">209</span></a>
while at fairs about the country were acted farces called &ldquo;drolls,&rdquo;
consisting of the most vulgar scenes to be found in popular plays.
Thus, the life of the drama was not absolutely extinguished;
and its darkest day proved briefer than perhaps either its friends
or its foes could have supposed.</p>

<p>Already &ldquo;in Oliver&rsquo;s time&rdquo; private performances took place
from time to time at noblemen&rsquo;s houses and (though not undisturbed)
in the old haunt of the drama, the Red
Bull. In 1656 the ingenuity of Sir William Davenant
<span class="sidenote">Revival of the drama.</span>
whose name (though not really so significant in the
dramatic as in another field of English literature) is
memorable as connecting together two distinct periods in it,
ventured on a bolder step in the production of a quasi-dramatic
entertainment &ldquo;of declamation and music&rdquo;; and in the following
year he brought out with scenery and music a piece which was
afterwards in an enlarged form acted and printed as the first
part of his opera, <i>The Siege of Rhodes</i>. This entertainment he
afterwards removed from the private house where it had been
produced to the Cockpit, where he soon ventured upon the
performance of regular plays written by himself. Thus, under
the cover of two sister arts, whose aid was in the sequel to prove
by no means altogether beneficial to its progress, the English
drama had boldly anticipated the Restoration, and was no longer
hiding its head when that much-desired event was actually
brought about. Soon after Charles II.&rsquo;s entry into London,
two theatrical companies are known to have been acting in the
capital. For these companies patents were soon granted, under
the names of &ldquo;the Duke (of York)&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;the King&rsquo;s Servants,&rdquo;
to Davenant and one of the brothers Killigrew respectively&mdash;the
former from 1662 acting at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, then at
Dorset Garden in Salisbury Court, the latter from 1663 at the
Theatre Royal near Drury Lane. These companies were united
from 1682, a royal licence being granted in 1695 to a rival
company which performed in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, and which
migrated to Covent Garden in 1733. Meanwhile, Vanbrugh had
in 1705 built the theatre in the Haymarket; and a theatre in
Goodman&rsquo;s Fields&mdash;afterwards rendered famous by the first
appearance of Garrick&mdash;led a fitful existence from 1729 to 1733.
The act of 1737 deprived the crown of the power of licensing
any more theatres; so that the history of the English stage for
a long period was confined to a restricted area. The rule which
prevailed after the Restoration, that neither of the rival companies
should ever attempt a play produced by the other, operated
beneficially both upon the activity of dramatic authorship
and upon the progress of the art of acting, which was not exposed
to the full effects of that deplorable spirit of personal rivalry
which too often leads even most intelligent actors to attempt
parts for which they have no special qualification. There can be
little doubt that the actor&rsquo;s art has rarely flourished more in
England than in the days of T. Betterton and his contemporaries,
among whose names those of Hart, Mohun, Kynaston, Nokes,
Mrs Barry, Mrs Betterton, Mrs Bracegirdle and Mrs Eleanor
Gwyn have, together with many others, survived in various
connexions among the memories of the Restoration age. No
higher praise has ever been given to an actor than that which
Addison bestowed upon Betterton, in describing his performance
of <i>Othello</i> as a proof that Shakespeare could not have written the
most striking passages of the character otherwise than he has
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page527" id="page527"></a>527</span></p>

<p>It may here be noticed that the fortunes of the Irish theatre
in general followed those of the English, of which of course it was
merely a branch. Of native dramatic compositions in
earlier times not a trace remains in Ireland; and the
<span class="sidenote">The Irish stage.</span>
drama was introduced into that country as an English
exotic&mdash;apparently already in the reign of Henry VIII., and
more largely in that of Elizabeth. The first theatre in Dublin
was built in 1635; but in 1641 it was closed, and even after the
Restoration the Irish stage continued in a precarious condition
till near the end of the century. About that time an extraordinarily
strong taste for the theatre took possession of Irish
society, and during the greater part of the 18th century the
Dublin stage rivalled the English in the brilliancy of its stars.
Betterton&rsquo;s rival, R. Wilks, Garrick&rsquo;s predecessor in the homage
paid to Shakespeare, Macklin, and his competitor for favour,
the &ldquo;silver-tongued&rdquo; Barry, were alike products of the Irish
stage, as were Mrs Woffington and other well-known actresses.
Nor should it be forgotten that three of the foremost English
writers of comedy in its later days, Congreve, Farquhar and
Sheridan, were Irish, the first by education, and the latter two
by birth also.</p>

<p>Already in the period preceding the outbreak of the Civil
War the English drama had perceptibly sunk from the height
to which it had been raised by the great Elizabethans.
When it had once more recovered possession of that
<span class="sidenote">The later Stuart drama.</span>
arena with which no living drama can dispense, it
would have been futile to demand that the dramatists
should return altogether into the ancient paths, unaffected by
the influences, native or foreign, in operation around them.
But there was no reason why the new drama should not, like the
Elizabethan, have been true in spirit to the higher purposes of
the dramatic art, to the nobler tendencies of the national life,
and to the demands of moral law. Because the later Stuart
drama as a whole proved untrue to these, and, while following
its own courses, never more than partially returned from the
aberrations to which it condemned itself, its history is that of a
decay which the indisputable brilliancy, borrowed or original,
of many of its productions is incapable of concealing.</p>

<p>Owing in part to the influence of the French theatre, which
by this time had taken the place of the Spanish as the ruling
drama of Europe, the separation between tragedy and
comedy is clearly marked in post-Restoration plays.
<span class="sidenote">Tragedy.</span>
Comic scenes are still occasionally introduced into tragedies
by some dramatists who adhered more closely to the Elizabethan
models (such as Otway and Crowne), but the practice fell into
disuse; while the endeavour to elevate comedy by pathetic
scenes and motives is one of the characteristic marks of the
beginning of another period in English dramatic literature.
The successive phases through which English tragedy passed in
the later Stuart times cannot be always kept distinct from one
another; and the guidance offered by the theories put forth by
some of the dramatists in support of their practice is often
delusive. Following the example of Corneille, Dryden and his
contemporaries and successors were fond of proclaiming their
adherence to this or that principle of dramatic construction or
form, and of upholding, with much show of dialectical acumen,
maxims derived by them from French or other sources, or
elaborated with modifications and variations of their own, but
usually amounting to little more than what Scott calls &ldquo;certain
romantic whimsical imitations of the dramatic art.&rdquo; Students
of the drama will find much entertainment and much instruction
in these prefaces, apologies, dialogues and treatises. They will
acknowledge that Dryden&rsquo;s incomparable vigour does not desert
him either in the exposing or in the upholding of fallacies, while
<i>le bon sens</i>, which he hardly ever fails to exhibit, and which is a
more eclectic gift than common-sense, serves as a sure guide
to the best intelligence of his age. Even Rymer,<a name="fa210a" id="fa210a" href="#ft210a"><span class="sp">210</span></a> usually regarded
as having touched the nadir of dramatic criticism, will be found
to be not wholly without grains of salt. But Restoration tragedy
itself must not be studied by the light of Restoration criticism.
So long as any dramatic power remained in the tragic poets&mdash;and
it is absent from none of the chief among them from Dryden
to Rowe&mdash;the struggle between fashion (disguised as theory)
and instinct (tending in the direction of the Elizabethan traditions)
could never wholly determine itself in favour of the
former.</p>

<p>Lord Orrery, in deference, as he declares, to the expressed
tastes of his sovereign King Charles II. himself, was the first to
set up the standard of <i>heroic plays</i>.<a name="fa211a" id="fa211a" href="#ft211a"><span class="sp">211</span></a> This new species of tragedy
(for such it professed to be) commended itself by its novel choice
of themes, to a large extent supplied by recent French romance&mdash;the
<i>romans de longue haleine</i> of the Scudérys and their contemporaries&mdash;and
by French plays treating similar themes.
It likewise borrowed from France that garb of rhyme which the
English drama had so long abandoned, and which now reappeared
in the heroic couplet. But the themes which to readers
of novels might seem of their nature inexhaustible could not long
suffice to satisfy the more capricious appetite of theatrical
audiences; and the form, in the application which it was more
or less sought to enforce for it, was doomed to remain an exotic.
In conjunction with his brother-in-law Sir R. Howard,<a name="fa212a" id="fa212a" href="#ft212a"><span class="sp">212</span></a> and
afterwards more confidently by himself,<a name="fa213a" id="fa213a" href="#ft213a"><span class="sp">213</span></a> Dryden threw the incomparable
vigour and brilliancy of his genius into the scale,
which soon rose to the full height of fashionable popularity.
At first he claimed for English tragedy the right to combine her
native inheritance of freedom with these valuable foreign
acquisitions.<a name="fa214a" id="fa214a" href="#ft214a"><span class="sp">214</span></a> Nor was he dismayed by the ridicule which the
celebrated burlesque (by the duke of Buckingham and others)
of <i>The Rehearsal</i> (1671) cast upon heroic plays, without discriminating
between them and such other materials for ridicule
as the contemporary drama supplied to its facetious authors,
but returned<a name="fa215a" id="fa215a" href="#ft215a"><span class="sp">215</span></a> to the defence of a species which he was himself in
the end to abandon.<a name="fa216a" id="fa216a" href="#ft216a"><span class="sp">216</span></a> The desire for change proved stronger
than the love of consistency&mdash;which in Dryden was never more
than theoretical. After summoning tragedy to rival the freedom
(without disdaining the machinery) of opera&mdash;with whose birth
its own revival was as a matter of fact simultaneous&mdash;he came
to recognize in characterization the truest secret of the master-spirit
of the Elizabethan drama,<a name="fa217a" id="fa217a" href="#ft217a"><span class="sp">217</span></a> and after audaciously, but in
one instance not altogether unhappily, essaying to rival Shakespeare
on his own ground,<a name="fa218a" id="fa218a" href="#ft218a"><span class="sp">218</span></a> produced under the influence of the
same views at least one work of striking merit.<a name="fa219a" id="fa219a" href="#ft219a"><span class="sp">219</span></a> But he was
already growing weary of the stage itself as well as of the rhymed
heroic drama; and, though he put an end to the species to which
he had given temporary vitality, he failed effectively to point
the way to a more legitimate development of English tragedy.
Among the other tragic poets of this period, N. Lee, in the outward
form of his dramas, accommodated his practice to that of
Dryden, with whom he occasionally co-operated as a dramatist,
and like whom he allowed political partisanship to intrude upon
the stage.<a name="fa220a" id="fa220a" href="#ft220a"><span class="sp">220</span></a> His rhetorical genius was not devoid of genuine
energy, nor is he to be regarded as a mere imitator. T. Otway,
the most gifted tragic poet of the younger generation contemporary
with Dryden, inherited something of the spirit of the
Elizabethan drama; he possessed a real gift of tragic pathos
and melting tenderness; but his genius had a worse alloy than
stageyness, and, though he was often happy in his novel choice
of themes, his most successful efforts fail to satisfy tests supplementary
to that of the stage.<a name="fa221a" id="fa221a" href="#ft221a"><span class="sp">221</span></a>  Among dramatists who contributed
to the vogue of the &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; play may be mentioned
J. Bankes, J. Weston, C. Hopkins, E. Cooke, R. Gould, S. Pordage,
T. Rymer and Elkanah Settle. The productivity of J. Crowne
(d. c. 1703)<a name="fa222a" id="fa222a" href="#ft222a"><span class="sp">222</span></a> covers part of the earlier period as well as of the later,
to which properly belong T. Southerne, a writer gifted with much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page528" id="page528"></a>528</span>
pathetic power, but probably chiefly indebted for his long-lived
popularity to his skill in the discovery of &ldquo;sensational&rdquo; plots;
and Lord Lansdowne (&ldquo;Granville the polite&rdquo;) (c. 1667-1735).
Congreve, by virtue of a single long celebrated but not really
remarkable tragedy,<a name="fa223a" id="fa223a" href="#ft223a"><span class="sp">223</span></a> and N. Rowe, may be further singled out
from the list of the tragic dramatists of this period, many of
whom were, like their comic contemporaries, mere translators
or adapters from the French. The tragedies of Rowe, whose
direct services to the study of Shakespeare deserve remembrance,
indicate with singular distinctness the transition from the fuller
declamatory style of Dryden to the calmer and thinner manner
of Addison.<a name="fa224a" id="fa224a" href="#ft224a"><span class="sp">224</span></a> In tragedy (as to a more marked degree in comedy)
the excesses (both of style and subject) of the past period of the
English drama had produced an inevitable reaction; decorum
was asserting its claims on the stage as in society; and French
tragedy had set the example of sacrificing what passion&mdash;and
what vigour&mdash;it retained in favour of qualities more acceptable
to the &ldquo;reformed&rdquo; court of Louis XIV. Addison, in allowing
his <i>Cato</i> to take its chance upon the stage, when a moment
of political excitement (April 1713) ensured to it an extraordinary
success, to which no feature in it corresponds, except an unusual
number of lines predestined to become familiar quotations,
unconsciously sealed the doom of English national tragedy.
The &ldquo;first reasonable English tragedy,&rdquo; as Voltaire called it,
had been produced, and the oscillations of the tragic drama of
the Restoration were at an end.</p>

<p>English comedy in this period displayed no similar desire
to cut itself off from the native soil, though it freely borrowed
the materials for its plots and many of its figures from
Spanish, and afterwards more generally from French,
<span class="sidenote">Comedy.</span>
originals. The spirit of the old romantic comedy had long since
fled; the graceful artificialities of the pastoral drama, even the
light texture of the mask, ill suited the demands of an age which
made no secret to itself of the grossness of its sensuality. With
a few unimportant exceptions, such poetic elements as admitted
of being combined with the poetic drama were absorbed by the
opera and the ballet. No new species of the comic drama formed
itself, though towards the close of the period may be noticed
the beginnings of modern English farce. Political and religious
partisanship, generally in accordance with the dominant reaction
against Puritanism, were allowed to find expression in the
directest and coarsest forms upon the stage, and to hasten the
necessity for a more systematic control than even the times
before the Revolution had found requisite. At the same time the
unblushing indecency which the Restoration had spread through
court and capital had established its dominion over the comic
stage, corrupting the manners, and with them the morals, of
its dramatists, and forbidding them, at the risk of seeming
dull, to be anything but improper. Much of this found its way
even into the epilogues, which, together with the prologues,
proved so important an adjunct of the Restoration drama.
These influences determine the general character of what is
with a more than chronological meaning termed the comedy of
the Restoration. In construction, the national love of fulness
and solidity of dramatic treatment induced its authors to alter
what they borrowed from foreign sources, adding to complicated
Spanish plots characters of native English directness, and
supplementing single French plots by the addition of others.<a name="fa225a" id="fa225a" href="#ft225a"><span class="sp">225</span></a>
At the same time, the higher efforts of French comedy of character,
as well as the refinement of expression in the list of their
models, notably in Molière, were alike seasoned to suit the
coarser appetites and grosser palates of English patrons. The
English comic writers often succeeded in strengthening the
borrowed texture of their plays, but they never added comic
humour without at the same time adding coarseness of their own.
Such were the productions of Sir George Etheredge, Sir Charles
Sedley, and the &ldquo;mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease&rdquo;; nor
was there any signal difference between their productions and
those of a playwright-actor such as J. Lacy (d. 1681), and a
professional dramatist of undoubted ability such as J. Crowne.
Such, though often displaying the brilliancy of a genius which
even where it sank could never wholly abandon its prerogative,
were, it must be confessed, the comedies of Dryden himself.
On the other hand, the lowest literary deeps of the Restoration
drama were sounded by T. D&rsquo;Urfey, while of its moral degradation
the &ldquo;divine Astraea,&rdquo; the &ldquo;unspeakable&rdquo; Mrs Aphra Behn,
has an indefeasible title to be considered the most faithful
representative. T. Shadwell, fated, like the tragic poet Elkanah
Settle, to be chiefly remembered as a victim of Dryden&rsquo;s satire,
deserves more honourable mention. Like J. Wilson, whose plays
seem to class him with the pre-Restoration dramatists, Shadwell
had caught something not only of the art, but also of the spirit,
of Ben Jonson; but in most of his works he was, like the rest
of his earlier contemporaries, and like the brilliant group which
succeeded them, content to take his moral tone from the reckless
society for which, or in deference to the tastes of which, he wrote.<a name="fa226a" id="fa226a" href="#ft226a"><span class="sp">226</span></a>
The absence of a moral sense, which, together with a grossness
of expression often defying exaggeration, characterizes English
comic dramatists from the days of Dryden to those of Congreve,
is the main cause of their failure to satisfy the demands which
are legitimately to be made upon their art. They essayed to
draw character as well as to paint manners, but they rarely
proved equal to the former and higher task; and, while choosing
the means which most readily commended their plays to the
favour of their immediate public, they achieved but little as
interpreters of those essential distinctions which their art is
capable of illustrating.<a name="fa227a" id="fa227a" href="#ft227a"><span class="sp">227</span></a> Within these limits, though occasionally
passing beyond them, and always with the same deference to the
immoral tone which seemed to have become an indispensable
adjunct of the comic style, even the greatest comic authors of
this age moved. W. Wycherley was a comic dramatist of real
power, who drew his characters with vigour and distinctness,
and constructed his plots and chose his language with natural
ease. He lacks gaiety of spirit, and his wit is of a cynical turn.
But, while he ruthlessly uncloaks the vices of his age, his own
moral tone is affected by their influence in as marked a degree
as that of the most light-hearted of his contemporaries.<a name="fa228a" id="fa228a" href="#ft228a"><span class="sp">228</span></a> The
most brilliant of these was indisputably W. Congreve, who is not
only one of the very wittiest of English writers, but equally excels
in the graceful ease of his dialogue, and draws his characters
and constructs his plots with the same masterly skill. His chief
fault as a dramatist is one of excess&mdash;the brilliancy of the
dialogue, whoever be the speaker, overpowers the distinction
between the &ldquo;humours&rdquo; of his personages. Though he is less
brutal in expression than &ldquo;manly&rdquo; Wycherley, and less coarse
than the lively Sir J. Vanbrugh, licentiousness in him as in
them corrupts the spirit of his comic art; but of his best though
not most successful play<a name="fa229a" id="fa229a" href="#ft229a"><span class="sp">229</span></a> it must be allowed that the issue of the
main plot is on the side of virtue. G. Farquhar, whose morality
is on a par with that of the other members of this group, is inferior
to them in brilliancy; but as pictures of manners in a wider
sphere of life than that which contemporary comedy usually
chose to illustrate, two of his plays deserve to be noticed, in
which we already seem to be entering the atmosphere of the
18th-century novel.<a name="fa230a" id="fa230a" href="#ft230a"><span class="sp">230</span></a> His influence upon Lessing is a remarkable
fact in the international history of dramatic literature.</p>

<p>The improvement which now begins to manifest itself in the
moral tone and spirit of English comedy is partly due to the
reaction against the reaction of the Restoration, partly to the
punishment which the excesses of the comic stage had brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page529" id="page529"></a>529</span>
upon it in the invective of Jeremy Collier<a name="fa231a" id="fa231a" href="#ft231a"><span class="sp">231</span></a> (1698), of all the
assaults the theatre in England has had to undergo the best-founded,
<span class="sidenote">Sentimental comedy.</span>
and that which produced the most perceptible
results. The comic poets, who had always been more or
less conscious of their sins, and had at all events not
defended them by the ingenious sophistries which
it has pleased later literary criticism to suggest on their behalf,
now began with uneasy merriment to allude in their prologues
to the reformation which had come over the spirit of the town.
Writers like Mrs Centlivre became anxious to reclaim their
offenders with much emphasis in the fifth act; and Colley Cibber&mdash;whose
<i>Apology for his Life</i> furnishes a useful view of this and
the subsequent period of the history of the stage, with which
he was connected as author, manager and actor (excelling in
this capacity as representative of those fools with which he
peopled the comic stage)<a name="fa232a" id="fa232a" href="#ft232a"><span class="sp">232</span></a>&mdash;may be credited with having first
deliberately made the pathetic treatment of a moral sentiment
the basis of the action of a comic drama. But he cannot be said
to have consistently pursued the vein which in his <i>Careless
Husband</i> (1704) he had essayed. His <i>Non-Juror</i> is a political
adaptation of <i>Tartuffe</i>; and his almost equally celebrated
<i>Provoked Husband</i> only supplied a happy ending to Vanbrugh&rsquo;s
unfinished play. Sir R. Steele, in accordance with his general
tendencies as a writer, pursued a still more definite moral purpose
in his comedies; but his genius perhaps lacked the sustained
vigour necessary for a dramatist, and his humour naturally
sought the aid of pathos. From partial<a name="fa233a" id="fa233a" href="#ft233a"><span class="sp">233</span></a> he passed to more
complete<a name="fa234a" id="fa234a" href="#ft234a"><span class="sp">234</span></a> experiment; and thus these two writers, who transplanted
to the comic stage a tendency towards the treatment
of domestic themes noticeable in such writers of Restoration
tragedy as Southerne and Rowe, became the founders of <i>sentimental
comedy</i>, a species which exercised a most depressing
influence upon the progress of English drama, and helped to
hasten the decline of its comic branch. With <i>Cato</i> English
tragedy committed suicide, though its pale ghost survived;
with <i>The Conscious Lovers</i> English comedy sank for long into
the tearful embraces of artificiality and weakness.</p>

<p>During the 18th century the productions of dramatic literature
were still as a rule legitimately designed to meet the demands
of the stage, from which its higher efforts afterwards
to so large an extent became dissociated. The goodwill
<span class="sidenote">The drama and stage in the period before Garrick.</span>
of most sections of the public continued to be steadily
accorded to a theatre which had ceased to defy the
accepted laws and traditions of morality; and the
opposition still aroused by it was confined to a small
minority of thinkers, though these included some who were
far from being puritans. John Dennis was not thought to have
the worst of the controversy, when he defended the stage against
the attack of an opponent far above him in stature&mdash;the great
mystic William Law<a name="fa235a" id="fa235a" href="#ft235a"><span class="sp">235</span></a>&mdash;and to John Wesley himself it seemed
that &ldquo;a great deal more might be said in defence of seeing a
serious tragedy&rdquo; than of taking part in the amusements of
bear-baiting and cock-fighting. On the other hand, the demands
of the stage and those of its patrons and of the public of the
&ldquo;Augustan&rdquo; age, and of that which succeeded it, were, in
general, fast bound by the trammels of a taste with which a
revival of the poetic drama long remained irreconcilable. There
is every reason to conclude that the art of acting progressed
in the same direction of artificiality, and became stereotyped
in forms corresponding to the &ldquo;chant&rdquo; which represented
tragic declamation in a series of actors ending with Quin and
Macklin. In the latter must be recognized features of a precursor,
but it was reserved to the genius of Garrick, whose
<span class="sidenote">Garrick.</span>
theatrical career extended from 1741 to 1776, to open
a new era in his art. His unparalleled success was due
in the first instance to his incomparable natural gifts; yet
these were indisputably enhanced by a careful and continued
literary training, and ennobled by a purpose which prompted
him to essay the noblest, as he was capable of performing
the most various, range of English theatrical characters. By
devoting himself as actor and manager with special zeal to the
production of Shakespeare, Garrick permanently popularized
on the national stage the greatest creations of English drama,
and indirectly helped to seal the doom of what survived of the
tendency to maintain in the most ambitious walks of dramatic
literature the nerveless traditions of the pseudo-classical school.
A generation of celebrated actors and actresses, many of whom
live for us in the drastic epigrams of Churchill&rsquo;s <i>Rosciad</i> (1761),
were his helpmates or his rivals; but their fame has paled,
while his is destined to endure as that of one of the typical
masters of his art.</p>

<p>The contrast between the tragedy of the 18th century and
those plays of Shakespeare and one or two other Elizabethans
which already before Garrick were known to the
English stage, was weakened by the mutilated form
<span class="sidenote">Decline of tragedy.</span>
in which the old masterpieces generally, if not always,
made their appearance there. Even so, however, there are
perhaps few instances in theatrical history in which so unequal
a competition was so long sustained. In the hands of the
tragic poets of the age of Pope, as well as that of Johnson,
tragedy had hopelessly stiffened into the forms of its accepted
French models. Direct reproductions of these continued, as in
Ambrose Philips&rsquo;s and Charles Johnson&rsquo;s (1679-1748) translations
from Racine, and Aaron Hill&rsquo;s from Voltaire. Among
other tragic dramatists of the earlier part of the century may be
mentioned J. Hughes, who, after assisting Addison in his <i>Cato</i>,
produced at least one praiseworthy tragedy of his own;<a name="fa236a" id="fa236a" href="#ft236a"><span class="sp">236</span></a>
E. Fenton, a joint translator of &ldquo;Pope&rsquo;s <i>Homer</i>&rdquo; and the
author of one extremely successful drama on a theme of singularly
enduring interest,<a name="fa237a" id="fa237a" href="#ft237a"><span class="sp">237</span></a> and L. Theobald the first hero of the <i>Dunciad</i>,
who, besides translations of Greek dramas, produced a few
more or less original plays, one of which he was daring enough
to father upon Shakespeare.<a name="fa238a" id="fa238a" href="#ft238a"><span class="sp">238</span></a> A more distinguished name is
that of J. Thomson, whose unlucky <i>Sophonisba</i> and subsequent
tragedies are, however, barely remembered by the side of his
poems (<i>The Seasons</i>, &amp;c.). The literary genius of E. Young, on
the other hand, possessed vigour and variety enough to distinguish
his tragedies from the ordinary level of Augustan plays;
in one of them he seems to challenge comparison in the treatment
of his theme with a very different rival,<a name="fa239a" id="fa239a" href="#ft239a"><span class="sp">239</span></a> but by his main characteristics
as a dramatist he belongs to the school of his contemporaries.
The endeavour of G. Lillo, in his <i>London Merchant,
or George Barnwell</i> (1731), to bring the tragic lessons of terror
and pity directly home to his fellow-citizens exercised an extraordinarily
widespread as well as enduring effect on the history
of the 18th-century drama. At home, they gave birth to the new,
or, more properly speaking, to the revived, species of domestic
tragedy, which connects itself more or less closely with a notable
epoch in the history of English prose-fiction as well as of English
painting. Abroad, this play&mdash;whose success was of the kind
which nothing can kill&mdash;supplied the text to the teachings of
Diderot, as well as an example to his own dramatic attempts;
and through Diderot the impulse communicated itself to Lessing,
and long exercised a great effect upon the literature of the
German stage. At the same time, it must be allowed that
Lillo&rsquo;s pedestrian muse failed in the end to satisfy higher artistic
demands than those met in his most popular play, while in
another<a name="fa240a" id="fa240a" href="#ft240a"><span class="sp">240</span></a> she was less consciously guilty of an aberration
towards that &ldquo;tragedy of destiny,&rdquo; which, in the modern drama
at least, obscures the ethical character of all tragic actions.
&ldquo;Classical&rdquo; tragedy in the generation of Dr Johnson pursued
the even tenor of its way, the dictator himself treading with
solemn footfall in the accustomed path,<a name="fa241a" id="fa241a" href="#ft241a"><span class="sp">241</span></a> and W. Mason
making the futile attempt to produce a close imitation of Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page530" id="page530"></a>530</span>
models.<a name="fa242a" id="fa242a" href="#ft242a"><span class="sp">242</span></a> The best-remembered tragedy of the century, Home&rsquo;s
<i>Douglas</i> (1757), was the production of an author whose famous
kinsman, David Hume (though no friend of the contemporary
English stage), had advised him &ldquo;to read Shakespeare, but to
get Racine and Voltaire by heart.&rdquo; The indisputable merits
of the play cannot blind us to the fact that <i>Douglas</i> is the
offspring of <i>Merope</i>.</p>

<p>While thus no high creative talent arose to revive the poetic
genius of English tragedy, comedy, which had to contend
against the same rivals, naturally met the demands
of the conflict with greater buoyancy. The history of
<span class="sidenote">English opera.</span>
the most formidable of those rivals, Music, forms no
part of this sketch; but the points of contact between its
progress and the history of dramatic literature cannot be altogether
left out of sight. H. Purcell&rsquo;s endeavours to unite
English music to the words of English poets were now a thing
of the past; analogous attempts in the direction of musical
dialogue, which have been insufficiently noticed, had likewise
proved transitory; and the isolated efforts of Addison<a name="fa243a" id="fa243a" href="#ft243a"><span class="sp">243</span></a> and
others to recover the operatic stage for the native tongue had
proved powerless. Italian texts, which had first made their
entrance piecemeal, in the end asserted themselves in their
entirety; and the marvellously assimilative genius of Handel
completed the triumphs of a form of art which no longer had
any connexion with the English drama, and which reached the
height of its fashionable popularity about the time when Garrick
began to adorn the national stage. In one form, however, the
English opera was preserved as a pleasing species of the popular
drama. The pastoral drama had (in 1725) produced an isolated
aftergrowth in Allan Ramsay&rsquo;s <i>Gentle Shepherd</i>, which, with
genuine freshness and humour, but without a trace of burlesque,
transferred to the scenery of the Pentland Hills the lovely tale
of Florizel and Perdita. The dramatic form of this poem is
only an accident, but it doubtless suggested an experiment of a
different kind to the most playful of London wits. Gay&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Newgate Pastoral&rdquo; of <i>The Beggar&rsquo;s Opera</i> (1728), in which the
amusing text of a burlesque farce was interspersed with songs
set to popular airs, caught the fancy of the town by this novel
combination, and became the ancestor of a series of agreeable
productions, none of which, however, not even its own continuation,
<i>Polly</i> (amazingly successful in book form, after its production
was forbidden by the lord chamberlain), have ever rivalled
it in success or celebrity. Among these may be mentioned the
pieces of I. Bickerstaffe<a name="fa244a" id="fa244a" href="#ft244a"><span class="sp">244</span></a> and C. Dibdin.<a name="fa245a" id="fa245a" href="#ft245a"><span class="sp">245</span></a> The opera in England,
as elsewhere, thus absorbed what vitality remained to the
pastoral drama, while to the ballet and the pantomime (whose
glories in England began at Covent Garden in 1733, and to
whose popularity even Garrick was obliged to defer) was left (in
the 18th century at all events) the inheritance of the external
attractions of the mask and the pageant.</p>

<p>In the face of such various rivalries it is not strange that
comedy, instead of adhering to the narrow path which Steele
and others had marked out for her, should have
permitted herself some vagaries of her own. Gay&rsquo;s
<span class="sidenote">Comedy. Burlesque.</span>
example pointed the way to a fatally facile form of the
comic art; and burlesque began to contribute its influence to
the decline of comedy. In an age when party-government was
severely straining the capabilities of its system, dramatic satire
had not far to look for a source of effective seasonings. The
audacity of H. Fielding, whose regular comedies (original or
adapted) have secured no enduring remembrance, but whose love
of parody was afterwards to suggest to him the theme of the
<span class="sidenote">The Licensing Act.</span>
first of the novels which have made his name immortal,
accordingly ventured in two extravaganzas<a name="fa246a" id="fa246a" href="#ft246a"><span class="sp">246</span></a> (so we
should call them in these days) upon a larger admixture
of political with literary and other satire. A third
attempt<a name="fa247a" id="fa247a" href="#ft247a"><span class="sp">247</span></a> (which never reached the stage) furnished the
offended minister, Sir Robert Walpole, with the desired occasion for
placing a curb upon the licence of the theatre, such as had already
been advocated by a representative of its old civic adversaries.
The famous act of 1737 asserted no new principle, but converted
into legal power the customary authority hither exercised by the
lord chamberlain (to whom it had descended from the master
of the revels). The regular censorship which this act established
has not appreciably affected the literary progress of the English
drama, and the objections which have been raised against it
seem to have addressed themselves to practice rather than to
principle. The liberty of the stage is a question differing in its
conditions from that of the liberty of speech in general, or even
from that of the liberty of the press; and occasional lapses of
official judgment weigh lightly in the balance against the obvious
advantages of a system which in a free country needs only the
vigilance of public opinion to prevent its abuse. The policy of
the restraint which the act of 1737 put upon the number of
playhouses is a different, but has long become an obsolete,
question.<a name="fa248a" id="fa248a" href="#ft248a"><span class="sp">248</span></a></p>

<p>Brought back into its accustomed grooves, English comedy
seemed inclined to leave to farce the domain of healthy ridicule,
and to coalesce with domestic tragedy in the attempt
to make the stage a vehicle of homespun didactic
<span class="sidenote">Comedy in the latter half of the 18th century.</span>
morality. Farce had now become a genuine English
species, and has as such retained its vitality through
all the subsequent fortunes of the stage; it was
actively cultivated by Garrick as both actor and author; and
he undoubtedly had more than a hand in the very best farce
of this age, which is ascribed to clerical authorship.<a name="fa249a" id="fa249a" href="#ft249a"><span class="sp">249</span></a> S. Foote,
whose comedies<a name="fa250a" id="fa250a" href="#ft250a"><span class="sp">250</span></a> and farces are distinguished both by wit and
by variety of characters (though it was an absurd misapplication
of a great name to call him the English Aristophanes), introduced
into comic acting the abuse of personal mimicry, for the exhibition
of which he ingeniously invented a series of entertainments,
the parents of a long progeny of imitations. Meanwhile,
the domestic drama of the sentimental kind achieved, though
not immediately, a success only inferior to that of <i>The London
Merchant</i>, in <i>The Gamester</i> of E. Moore, to which Garrick seems
to have directly contributed;<a name="fa251a" id="fa251a" href="#ft251a"><span class="sp">251</span></a> and sentimental comedy courted
sympathetic applause in the works of A. Murphy, the single
comedy of W. Whitehead,<a name="fa252a" id="fa252a" href="#ft252a"><span class="sp">252</span></a> and the earliest of H. Kelly.<a name="fa253a" id="fa253a" href="#ft253a"><span class="sp">253</span></a> It
cannot be said that this species was extinguished, as it is sometimes
assumed to have been, by O. Goldsmith; but he certainly
published a direct protest against it between the production
of his admirable character-comedy of <i>The Good-Natured Man</i>,
and his delightfully brisk and fresh <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>, which,
after startling critical propriety from its self-conceit, taught
comedy no longer to fear being true to herself. The most
successful efforts of the elder G. Colman<a name="fa254a" id="fa254a" href="#ft254a"><span class="sp">254</span></a> had in them something
of the spirit of genuine comedy, besides a finish which, however
playwrights may shut their eyes to the fact, is one of the qualities
which ensure a long life to a play. And in the masterpieces of
R. B. Sheridan some of the happiest features of the comedy of
Congreve were revived, together with its too uniform brilliancy
of dialogue, but without its indecency of tone. The varnish
of the age is indeed upon the style, and the hollowness of its
morality in much of the sentiment (even where that sentiment is
meant for the audience) of <i>The Rivals</i> and <i>The School for Scandal</i>;
but in tact of construction, in distinctness of characters, and in
pungency of social satire, they are to be ranked among the glories
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page531" id="page531"></a>531</span>
of English comedy. Something in Sheridan&rsquo;s style, but quite
without his brilliancy, is the most successful play<a name="fa255a" id="fa255a" href="#ft255a"><span class="sp">255</span></a> of the unfortunate
General Burgoyne. R. Cumberland, who too consciously
endeavoured to excel both in sentimental morality and
in comic characterization, in which he was devoid of depth,
closes the list of authors of higher pretensions who wrote for the
theatre.<a name="fa256a" id="fa256a" href="#ft256a"><span class="sp">256</span></a> Like him, Mrs Cowley<a name="fa257a" id="fa257a" href="#ft257a"><span class="sp">257</span></a> (&ldquo;Anna Matilda&rdquo;), T. Holcroft,<a name="fa258a" id="fa258a" href="#ft258a"><span class="sp">258</span></a>
and G. Colman the younger,<a name="fa259a" id="fa259a" href="#ft259a"><span class="sp">259</span></a> all writers of popular
comedies, as well as the prolific J. O&rsquo;Keefe (1746-1833), who
contributed to nearly every species of the comic drama, survived
into the 19th century. To an earlier date belong the favourite
burlesques of O&rsquo;Keefe&rsquo;s countryman K. O&rsquo;Hara<a name="fa260a" id="fa260a" href="#ft260a"><span class="sp">260</span></a> (d. 1782), good
examples of a species the further history of which may be left
aside. In the hands of at least one later writer, J. R. Planché,
it proved capable of satisfying a more refined taste than his
successors have habitually consulted.</p>

<p>The decline of dramatic composition of the higher class,
perceptible in the history of the English theatre about the
beginning of the 19th century, was justly attributed
by Sir Walter Scott to the wearing out of the French
<span class="sidenote">The English drama of the 19th century.</span>
model that had been so long wrought upon; but when
he asserted that the new impulse which was sought in
the dramatic literature of Germany was derived from
some of its worst, instead of from its noblest, productions&mdash;from
Kotzebue rather than from Lessing, Schiller and Goethe&mdash;he
showed a very imperfect acquaintance with a complicated
literary movement which was obliquely reflected in the stage-plays
of Iffland and his contemporaries. The change which was
coming over English literature was in truth of a wider and
deeper nature than it was possible for even one of its chief
representatives to perceive. As that literature freed itself from
the fetters so long worn by it as indispensable ornaments, and
threw aside the veil which had so long obscured both the full
glory of its past and the lofty capabilities of its future, it could not
resort except tentatively to a form which like the dramatic is
bound by a hundred bonds to the life of the age itself. Soon, the
poems with which Scott and Byron, and the unrivalled prose fictions
with which Scott, both satisfied and stimulated the imaginative
demands of the public, diverted the attention of the cultivated
classes from dramatic literature, which was unable to escape,
with the light foot of verse or prose fiction, into &ldquo;the new, the
romantic land.&rdquo; New themes, new ideas, new forms occupied
a new generation of writers and readers; nor did the drama
readily lend itself as a vessel into which to pour so many fermenting
elements. In Byron the impressions produced upon a mind
not less open to impulses from without than subjective in its
way of recasting them, called forth a series of dramatic attempts
betraying a more or less wilful ignorance of the demands of
dramatic compositions; his beautiful <i>Manfred</i>, partly suggested
by Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Faust</i>, and his powerful <i>Cain</i>, have but the form of
plays; his tragedies on Italian historical subjects show some
resemblance in their political rhetoric to the contemporary works
of Alfieri; his <i>Sardanapalus</i>, autobiographically interesting,
fails to meet the demands of the stage; his <i>Werner</i> (of which the
authorship has been ascribed to the duchess of Devonshire) is a
hastily dramatized sensation novel. To Coleridge (1772-1834),
who gave to English literature a splendidly loose translation of
Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Wallenstein</i>, the same poet&rsquo;s <i>Robbers</i> (to which Wordsworth&rsquo;s
only dramatic attempt, the <i>Borderers</i>, is likewise indebted)
had probably suggested the subject of his tragedy of
<i>Osorio</i>, afterwards acted under the title of <i>Remorse</i>. Far superior
to this is his later drama of <i>Zapolya</i>, a genuine homage to Shakespeare,
out of the themes of two of whose plays it is gracefully
woven. Scott, who in his earlier days had translated Goethe&rsquo;s
<i>Götz von Berlichingen</i>, gained no reputation by his own dramatic
compositions. W. S. Landor, apart from those <i>Imaginary
Conversations</i> upon which he best loved to expend powers of
observation and characterization such as have been given to
few playwrights, cast in a formally dramatic mould studies of
character of which the value is far from being confined to their
wealth in beauties of detail. Of these the magnificent, but in
construction altogether undramatic, <i>Count Julian</i>, is the most
noteworthy. Shelley&rsquo;s <i>The Cenci</i>, on the other hand, is not only
a poem of great beauty, but a drama of true power, abnormally
revolting indeed in theme, but singularly pure and delicate in
treatment. A humbler niche in the temple of dramatic literature
belongs to some of the plays of C. R. Maturin,<a name="fa261a" id="fa261a" href="#ft261a"><span class="sp">261</span></a> Sir T. N. Talfourd,<a name="fa262a" id="fa262a" href="#ft262a"><span class="sp">262</span></a>
and Dean Milman.<a name="fa263a" id="fa263a" href="#ft263a"><span class="sp">263</span></a></p>

<p>Divorced, except for passing moments, from the stage, English
dramatic literature could during much the greater part of the
19th century hardly be regarded as a connected national growth;
though, already in the last decades of the Victorian age, the
revival of public interest in the theatre co-operated with a
gradual change in poetic taste to awaken the hope of a future
living reunion. Among English poets who lived in this period,
Sir Henry Taylor probably approached nearest to the objective
treatment and the amplitude of style characteristic of the
Elizabethan drama.<a name="fa264a" id="fa264a" href="#ft264a"><span class="sp">264</span></a> R. H. Horne, long an almost solitary
survivor of the romantic school, was able in at least one memorable
dramatic attempt to revive something of the early Elizabethan
spirit.<a name="fa265a" id="fa265a" href="#ft265a"><span class="sp">265</span></a> Of the chief poets of the age, Tennyson only in his later
years addressed himself to a form of composition little suited
to his genius, though the very fact of the homage paid by him to
the national forms of the historic drama and of romantic comedy
could not fail to ennoble the contemporary stage.<a name="fa266a" id="fa266a" href="#ft266a"><span class="sp">266</span></a> Matthew
Arnold&rsquo;s stately revival of the traditions of classical tragedy
proper, on the other hand, deliberately excluded itself from any
such contact;<a name="fa267a" id="fa267a" href="#ft267a"><span class="sp">267</span></a> while Longfellow&rsquo;s refined literary culture and
graceful facility of form made ready use of a quasi-dramatic
medieval vesture.<a name="fa268a" id="fa268a" href="#ft268a"><span class="sp">268</span></a> William Morris&rsquo;s single &ldquo;morality,&rdquo; too,
cannot be regarded as a contribution to dramatic literature
proper.<a name="fa269a" id="fa269a" href="#ft269a"><span class="sp">269</span></a> Of very different importance are the excursions into
dramatic composition of Robert Browning, whose place in the
living inheritance of the English drama has in one instance at
least been not unsuccessfully vindicated by a later age, and
some of whose greatest gifts are beyond a doubt displayed in his
dramatic work;<a name="fa270a" id="fa270a" href="#ft270a"><span class="sp">270</span></a> and the sustained endeavours of A. C. Swinburne,
after adding a flower of exquisite beauty to the wreath
which the lovers of the Attic muse have laid at her feet, to enrich
the national historic drama by a trilogy instinct with the ardent
eloquence of passion.<a name="fa271a" id="fa271a" href="#ft271a"><span class="sp">271</span></a> Until a date too near the times in which
we live to admit of its being fixed with precision, most of the
English writers who sought to preserve a connexion between
their dramatic productions and the demands of the stage
addressed themselves to the theatrical rather than the literary
public&mdash;for the distinction, in those times at all events, was by
no means without a difference. The modestly simple and judiciously
concentrated efforts of Joanna Baillie deserve a respectful
remembrance in the records of literature as well as of the stage,
though the day has passed when the theory which suggested
her <i>Plays on the Passions</i> could find acceptance among critics,
or her exemplifications of it satisfy the demands of playgoers.
Sheridan Knowles, on the other hand, composed his conventional
semblances of genuine tragedy and comedy with a thorough
knowledge of stage effect, and some of them can hardly yet be
said to have vanished from the stage.<a name="fa272a" id="fa272a" href="#ft272a"><span class="sp">272</span></a> The first Lord Lytton,
though his plays were for the most part of a lighter texture,
showed even more artificiality of sentiment in their conception
and execution; but the romantic touch which he imparted to at
least one of them accounts for its long-lived popularity. Among
later Victorian playwrights T. W. Robertson brought back a
breath of naturalness into the acted comic drama; Tom Taylor,
rivalling Lope in fertility, made little pretence to original
invention, but adapted with an instinct that rarely failed him,
and materially helped to keep the theatrical diversions of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page532" id="page532"></a>532</span>
age sound and pure; an endeavour in which he had the co-operation
of Charles Reade and that of most of those who
competed with them for the favour of generations of playgoers
more easily contented than their successors. The one deplorable
aspect of this age of the English drama was to be found neither
in the sphere of tragedy nor in that of comedy&mdash;nor even in that
of farce. It was presented in the low depths of contemporary
burlesque, which had degenerated from the graceful extravaganza
of J. R. Planché into witless and tasteless emptiness.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, it was at this point that something like
real originality&mdash;discovering a new sub-species of its own&mdash;first
began, with the aid of a sister-art, to renovate the English
popular comic stage. At the beginning of the 19th century the
greatest tragic actress of the English theatre, Mrs Siddons, had
passed her prime; and before its second decade had closed, not
only she (1812) but her brother John Kemble (1817), the representative
of a grand style of acting which later generations
might conceivably find overpowering, had withdrawn from the
boards. Mrs Siddons was soon followed into retirement by her
successor Miss O&rsquo;Neill (1819); while Kemble&rsquo;s brilliant later
rival, Edmund Kean, an actor the intuitions of whose genius seem
to have supplied, so far as intuition ever can supply, the absence
of a consecutive self-culture, remained on the stage till his death
in 1833. Young, Macready, and others handed down some of
the traditions of the older school of acting to the very few artists
who remained to suggest its semblance to a later generation.
Even these&mdash;among them S. Phelps, whose special merit it was
to present to a later age, accustomed to elaborate theatrical
environments, dramatic masterpieces as dependent upon themselves
and adequate interpretation; and the foremost English
actress of the earlier Victorian age, Helen Faucit (Lady Martin)&mdash;were
unable to leave a school of acting behind them. Still less
was this possible to Charles Kean the younger, with whom the
decorative production of Shakespearian plays really had its
beginning; or even to Sir Henry Irving, an actor of genius, but
also an irrepressible and almost eccentric theatrical personality,
whose great service to the English drama was his faith in its
masterpieces. The comic stage was fortunate in an ampler
aftergrowth, from generation to generation, of the successors
of the old actors who live for us all in the reminiscences of
Charles Lamb; nor were the links suddenly snapped which
bound the humours of the present to those of the past. In the
first decade of the 20th century a generation still survived which
could recall, with many other similar joys, the brilliant levity
of Charles Mathews the younger; the not less irresistible stolidity
of J. B. Buckstone; the solemn fooling of H. Compton (1805-1877);
the subtle humours of J. L. Toole, and the frolic charm
of Marie Wilton (Lady Bancroft), the most original comic
actress of her time.</p>
<div class="author">(A. W. W.)</div>

<p><i>Recent English Drama.</i>&mdash;In England the whole mechanism
of theatrical life had undergone a radical change in the middle
decades of the 19th century. At the root of this change lay the
immense growth of population and the enormously increased
facilities of communication between London and the provinces.
Similar causes came into operation, of course, in France, Germany
and Austria, but were much less distinctly felt, because the
numerous and important subventioned theatres of these countries
remained more or less unaffected by economic influences. Free
trade in theatricals (subject only to certain licensing regulations
and to a court censorship of new plays) was established in
England by an act of 1843, which abolished the long moribund
monopoly of the &ldquo;legitimate drama&rdquo; claimed by the &ldquo;Patent
Theatres&rdquo; of Drury Lane and Covent Garden. The drama was
thus formally subjected to the operation of the law of supply and
demand, like any other article of commerce, and managers were
left, unaided and unhampered by any subvention or privilege,
to cater to the tastes of a huge and growing community. Theatres
very soon multiplied, competition grew ever keener, and the
long run, with its accompaniments of ostentatious decoration
and lavish advertisement, became the one object of managerial
effort. This process of evolution may be said to have begun in
the second quarter of the 19th century and completed itself in
the 3rd. The system which obtains to-day, almost unforeseen
in 1825, was in full operation in 1875. The repertory theatre,
with its constant changes of programme, maintained on the
continent partly by subventions, partly by the mere force of
artistic tradition, had become in England a faint and far-off
memory. There was not a single theatre in London at which
plays, old and new, were not selected and mounted solely with
a view to their continuous performance for as many nights as
possible, anything short of fifty nights constituting an ignominious
and probably ruinous failure. It was found, too, that
those theatres were most successful which were devoted exclusively
to exploiting the talent of an individual actor. Thus
when the fourth quarter of the century opened, the long &ldquo;run&rdquo;
and the actor-manager were in firm possession of the field.</p>

<p>The outlook was in many ways far from encouraging. It
was not quite so black, indeed, as it had been in the late &rsquo;fifties
and early &rsquo;sixties, when the &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; enterprises of Phelps
at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells and Charles Kean at the Princess&rsquo;s had failed
to hold their ground, and when modern comedy and drama were
represented almost exclusively by adaptations from the French.
There had been a slight stirring of originality in the series of
comedies produced by T. W. Robertson at the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s
theatre, where, under the management of Bancroft (<i>q.v.</i>) a new
school of mounting and acting, minutely faithful (in theory at
any rate) to everyday reality, had come into existence. But
the hopes of a revival of English comedy seemed to have died
with Robertson&rsquo;s death. One of his followers, James Albery,
possessed both imagination and wit, but had not the strength
of character to do justice to his talent, and sank into a mere
adapter. In the plays of another disciple, H. J. Byron, the
Robertsonian or &ldquo;cup-and-saucer&rdquo; school declined upon sheer
inanity. Of the numerous plays signed by Tom Taylor some
were original in substance, but all were cast in the machine-made
French mould. Wilkie Collins, in dramatizing some of his novels,
produced somewhat crude anticipations of the modern &ldquo;problem
play.&rdquo; The literary talent of W. S. Gilbert displayed itself in a
group of comedies both in verse and prose; but Gilbert saw life
from too peculiar an angle to represent it otherwise than fantastically.
The Robertsonian impulse seemed to have died utterly
away, leaving behind it only five or six very insubstantial
comedies and a subdued, unrhetorical method in acting. This
method the Bancrofts proceeded to apply, during the &rsquo;seventies,
to revivals of stage classics, such as <i>The School for Scandal</i>,
<i>Money</i> and <i>Masks and Faces</i>, and to adaptations from the French
of Sardou.</p>

<p>While the modern drama appeared to have relapsed into a
comatose condition, poetic and romantic drama was giving
some signs of life. At the Lyceum in 1871 Henry Irving had
leapt into fame by means of his performance of Mathias in
<i>The Bells</i>, an adaptation from the French of Erckmann-Chatrian.
He followed this up by an admirably picturesque performance
of the title-part in <i>Charles I.</i> by W. G. Wills. In the
autumn of 1874 the great success of Irving&rsquo;s Hamlet was hailed
as the prelude to a revival of tragic acting. As a matter of fact,
it was the prelude to a long series of remarkable achievements
in romantic drama and melodrama. Irving&rsquo;s lack of physical
and vocal resources prevented him from scaling the heights of
tragedy, and his Othello, Macbeth, and Lear could not be ranked
among his successes; but he was admirable in such parts as
Richard III., Shylock, Iago and Wolsey, while in melodramatic
parts, such as Louis XI. and the hero and villain of <i>The Lyons
Mail</i>, he was unsurpassed. Mephistopheles in a version of
<i>Faust</i> (1885), perhaps the greatest popular success of his career,
added nothing to his reputation for artistic intelligence; but
on the other hand his Becket in Tennyson&rsquo;s play of that name
(1893) was one of his most masterly efforts. His management
of the Lyceum (1878-1899) did so much to raise the status of
the actor and to restore the prestige of poetic drama, that the
knighthood conferred upon him in 1895 was felt to be no more
than an appropriate recognition of his services. But his
managerial career had scarcely any significance for the living
English drama. He seldom experimented with a new play,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page533" id="page533"></a>533</span>
and, of the few which he did produce, only <i>The Cup</i> and
<i>Becket</i> by Lord Tennyson have the remotest chance of being
remembered.</p>

<p>To trace the history of the new English drama, then, we must
go back to the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s theatre. Even while it seemed
that French comedy of the school of Scribe was resuming its
baneful predominance, the seeds of a new order of things were
slowly germinating. <i>Diplomacy</i>, an adaptation of Sardou&rsquo;s
<i>Dora</i>, produced in 1878, brought together on the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s
stage Mr and Mrs Bancroft, Mr and Mrs Kendal, John Clayton
and Arthur Cecil&mdash;in other words, the future managers of the
Haymarket, the St James&rsquo;s and the Court theatres, which were
destined to see the first real stirrings of a literary revival. Mr
and Mrs Kendal, who, in conjunction with John Hare, managed
the St James&rsquo;s theatre from 1879 to 1888, produced A. W.
Pinero&rsquo;s first play of any consequence, <i>The Money-Spinner</i> (1881),
and afterwards <i>The Squire</i> (1882) and <i>The Hobby Horse</i> (1887).
The Bancrofts, who, after entirely rebuilding the Haymarket
theatre, managed it from 1880 till their retirement in 1885,
produced in 1883 Pinero&rsquo;s <i>Lords and Commons</i>; and Messrs
Clayton and Cecil produced at the Court theatre between 1885
and 1887 his three brilliant farces, <i>The Magistrate</i>, <i>The Schoolmistress</i>
and <i>Dandy Dick</i>, which, with the sentimental comedy,
<i>Sweet Lavender</i>, produced at Terry&rsquo;s theatre in 1888, assured his
position as an original and fertile dramatic humorist of no small
literary power. It is to be noted, however, that Pinero was
almost the only original playwright represented under the
Bancroft, Hare-Kendal and Clayton-Cecil managements, which
relied for the rest upon adaptations and revivals. Adaptations
of French vaudevilles were the staple productions of Charles
Wyndham&rsquo;s management at the Criterion from its beginning
in 1876 until 1893, when he first produced an original play of any
importance. When Herbert Beerbohm Tree went into management
at the Haymarket in 1887, he still relied largely on plays
of foreign origin. George Alexander&rsquo;s first managerial ventures
(Avenue theatre, 1890) were two adaptations from the French.
Until well on in the &rsquo;eighties, indeed, adaptation from the French
was held the normal occupation of the British playwright, and
original composition a mere episode. Robertson, Byron, Albery,
Gilbert, Tom Taylor, Charles Reade, Herman Merivale, G. W.
Godfrey, all produced numerous adaptations; Sydney Grundy
was for twenty years occupied almost exclusively in this class
of work; Pinero himself has adapted more than one French play.
The &rsquo;eighties, then, may on the whole be regarded as showing
a very gradual decline in the predominance of France on the
English stage, and an equally slow revival of originality, so far
as comedy and drama were concerned, manifesting itself mainly
in the plays of Pinero.</p>

<p>The reaction against French influence, however, was no less
apparent in the domain of melodrama and operetta than in that
of comedy and drama. Until well on in the &rsquo;seventies, D&rsquo;Ennery
and his disciples, adapted and imitated by Dion Boucicault and
others, ruled the melodramatic stage. The reaction asserted
itself in two quarters&mdash;in the East End at the Grecian theatre,
and in the West End at the Princess&rsquo;s. In <i>The World</i>, produced
at Drury Lane in 1880, Paul Meritt (d. 1895) and Henry Pettitt
(d. 1893) brought to the West End the &ldquo;Grecian&rdquo; type of popular
drama; and at Drury Lane it survived in the elaborately
spectacular form imparted to it by Sir Augustus Harris, who
managed that theatre from 1879 till his death in 1896. The
production of G. R. Sims&rsquo;s <i>Lights o&rsquo; London</i> at the Princess&rsquo;s in
1881, under Wilson Barrett&rsquo;s management, also marked a new
departure. This style of melodrama was chiefly cultivated at
the Adelphi theatre, from 1882 until the end of the century,
when it died out there as a regular institution, apparently because
a host of suburban theatres drew away its audiences. Of all
these English melodramas, only one, <i>The Silver King</i>, by Henry
Arthur Jones (Princess&rsquo;s, 1882), could for a moment compare in
invention or technical skill with the French dramas they supplanted.
The fact remains, however, that even on this lowest
level of dramatic art the current of the time set decisively towards
home-made pictures of English life, however crude and puerile.</p>

<p>For twenty-five years, from 1865 to 1890, the English stage
was overrun with French operettas of the school of Offenbach.
Hastily adapted by slovenly hacks, their librettos (often witty
in the original) became incredible farragos of metreless doggrel
and punning ineptitude. The great majority of them are now
so utterly forgotten that it is hard to realize how, in their heyday,
they swarmed on every hand in London and the provinces. The
reaction began in 1875 with the performance at the Royalty
theatre of <i>Trial by Jury</i>, by W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan.
This was the prelude to that brilliant series of witty and melodious
extravaganzas which began with <i>The Sorcerer</i> at the Opera
Comique theatre in 1877, but was mainly associated with the
Savoy theatre, opened by R. D&rsquo;Oyly Carte (d. 1901) in 1881.
Little by little the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas (of which
the most famous, perhaps, were <i>H.M.S. Pinafore</i>, 1878, <i>Patience</i>,
1881, and <i>The Mikado</i>, 1885) undermined the popularity of the
French opera-bouffes, and at the same time that of the indigenous
&ldquo;burlesques&rdquo; which, graceful enough in the hands of their
inventor J. R. Planché, had become mere incoherent jumbles of
buffoonery, devoid alike of dramatic ingenuity and of literary
form. When, early in the &rsquo;nineties, the collaboration between
Gilbert and Sullivan became intermittent, and the vogue of the
Savoy somewhat declined, a new class of extravaganza arose,
under the designation of &ldquo;musical comedy&rdquo; or &ldquo;musical farce.&rdquo;
It first took form in a piece called <i>In Town</i>, by Messrs &ldquo;Adrian
Ross&rdquo; and Osmond Carr (Prince of Wales&rsquo;s theatre, 1892), and
rapidly became very popular. In these plays the scene and
costumes are almost always modern though sometimes exotic,
and the prose dialogue, setting forth an attenuated and entirely
negligible plot, is frequently interrupted by musical numbers.
The lyrics are often very clever pieces of rhyming, totally different
from the inane doggrel of the old opera-bouffes and burlesques.
In other respects there is little to be said for the literary or
intellectual quality of &ldquo;musical farce&rdquo;; but, being an entirely
English (or Anglo-American) product, it falls into line with the
other indications we have noted of the general decline&mdash;one might
almost say extinction&mdash;of French influence on the English
stage.</p>

<p>To what causes are we to trace this gradual disuse of adaptation?
In the domain of modern comedy and drama, to two
causes acting simultaneously: the decline in France of the
method of Scribe, which produced &ldquo;well-made,&rdquo; exportable
plays, more or less suited to any climate and environment;
and the rise in England of a generation of playwrights more
original, thoughtful and able than their predecessors. It is not
at all to be taken for granted that the falling off in the supply of
exportable plays meant a decline in the absolute merit of French
drama. The historian of the future may very possibly regard
the movement in France, no less than the movement in England,
as a step in advance, and may even see in the two movements
co-ordinate manifestations of one tendency. Be this as it may,
the fact is certain that as the playwrights of the Second Empire
gradually died off, and were succeeded by the authors of the
&ldquo;new comedy,&rdquo; plays which would bear transplantation became
ever fewer and farther between. Of recent years Henri Bernstein,
author of <i>Le Voleur</i> and <i>Samson</i>, has been almost the only
French dramatist whose works have found a ready and steady
market in England. Attempts to acclimatize French poetical
drama&mdash;<i>Pour la Couronne</i>, <i>Le Chemineau</i>, <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>&mdash;were
all more or less unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Having noted the decline of adaptation, we may now trace a
stage farther the development of the English drama. The first
stage, already surveyed, ends with the production of <i>Sweet
Lavender</i> in 1888. Up to this point its author, Pinero (b. 1855),
stood practically alone, and had won his chief successes as a
humorist. Henry Arthur Jones (b. 1851) was known as little
more than an able melodramatist, though in one play, <i>Saints
and Sinners</i> (1884), he had made some attempt at a serious
study of provincial life. R. C. Carton (b. 1856) had written, in
collaboration, one or two plays of slight account. Sydney
Grundy (b. 1848) had produced scarcely any original work.
The second stage may be taken as extending from 1889 to 1893.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page534" id="page534"></a>534</span>
On the 24th of April 1889 John Hare opened the new Garrick
theatre with <i>The Profligate</i>, by Pinero&mdash;an unripe and superficial
piece of work in many ways, but still a great advance, both in
ambition and achievement, upon any original work the stage
had seen for many a year.</p>

<p>With all its faults, it may be said that <i>The Profligate</i> notably
enlarged at one stroke the domain open to the English dramatist.
And it did not stand alone. The same year saw the production
of two plays by H. A. Jones, <i>Wealth</i> and <i>The Middleman</i>, in
which a distinct effort towards a serious criticism of life was
observable, and of two plays by Sydney Grundy, <i>A Fool&rsquo;s
Paradise</i> and <i>A White Lie</i>, which, though very French in method,
were at least original in substance. Jones during the next two
years made a steady advance with <i>Judah</i> (1890), <i>The Dancing
Girl</i> and <i>The Crusaders</i> (1891). Pinero in these years was putting
forth less than his whole strength in <i>The Cabinet Minister</i> (1890),
<i>Lady Bountiful</i> and <i>The Times</i> (1891), and <i>The Amazons</i> (March
1893). But meanwhile new talents were coming forward. The
management of George Alexander, which opened at the Avenue
theatre in 1890, but was transferred in the following year to the
St James&rsquo;s, brought prominently to the front R. C. Carton,
Haddon Chambers and Oscar Wilde. Carton&rsquo;s two sentimental
comedies, <i>Sunlight and Shadow</i> (1890) and <i>Liberty Hall</i> (1892),
showed excellent workmanship, but did not yet reveal his true
originality as a humorist. Haddon Chambers&rsquo;s work (notably
<i>The Idler</i>, 1891) was as yet sufficiently commonplace; but in
<i>Lady Windermere&rsquo;s Fan</i> (1892) Oscar Wilde showed himself at
his first attempt a brilliant and accomplished dramatist. Wilde&rsquo;s
subsequent plays, <i>A Woman of No Importance</i> (1893) and <i>An
Ideal Husband</i> and <i>The Importance of being Earnest</i> (1895),
though marred by mannerism and insincerity, did much to
promote the movement we are here tracing.</p>

<p>As the production of <i>The Profligate</i> marked the opening
of the second period in the revival of English drama, so the
production of the same author&rsquo;s <i>The Second Mrs Tanqueray</i> is
very clearly the starting-point of the third period. Before
attempting to trace its course we may do well to glance at certain
conditions which probably influenced it.</p>

<p>In the first place, economic conditions. The Bancroft-Robertson
movement at the old Prince of Wales&rsquo;s, between
1865 and 1870, was of even more importance from an economic
than from a literary point of view. By making their little theatre
a luxurious place of resort, and faithfully imitating in their
productions the accent, costume and furniture of upper and
upper-middle class life, the Bancrofts had initiated a reconciliation
between society and the stage. Throughout the middle
decades of the century it was the constant complaint of the
managers that the world of wealth and fashion could not be
tempted to the theatre. The Bancroft management changed all
that. It was at the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s that half-guinea stalls were
first introduced; and these stalls were always filled. As other
theatres adopted the same policy of upholstery, both on and off
the stage, fashion extended its complaisance to them as well. In
yet another way the reconciliation was promoted&mdash;by the ever-increasing
tendency of young men and women of good birth and
education to seek a career upon the English stage. The theatre,
in short, became at this period one of the favourite amusements
of fashionable (though scarcely of intellectual) society in
London. It is often contended that the influence of the sensual
and cynical stall audience is a pernicious one. In some ways,
no doubt, it is detrimental; but there is another side to the case.
Even the cynicism of society marks an intellectual advance upon
the sheer rusticity which prevailed during the middle years of the
19th century and accepted without a murmur plays (original and
adapted) which bore no sort of relation to life. In a celebrated
essay published in 1879, Matthew Arnold (whose occasional
dramatic criticisms were very influential in intellectual circles)
dwelt on the sufficiently obvious fact that the result of giving
English names and costumes to French characters was to make
their sayings and doings utterly unreal and &ldquo;fantastic.&rdquo; During
the years of French ascendancy, audiences had quite forgotten
that it was possible for the stage to be other than &ldquo;fantastic&rdquo;
in this sense. They no longer thought of comparing the mimic
world with the real world, but were content with what may be
called abstract humour and pathos, often of the crudest quality.
The cultivation of external realism, coinciding with, and in
part occasioning, the return of society to the playhouse, gradually
led to a demand for some approach to plausibility in character
and action as well as in costume and decoration. The stage
ceased to be entirely &ldquo;fantastic,&rdquo; and began to essay, however
imperfectly, the representation, the criticism of life. It cannot
be denied that the influence of society tended to narrow the
outlook of English dramatists and to trivialize their tone of
thought. But this was a passing phase of development; and
cleverly trivial representations of reality are, after all, to be
preferred to brainless concoctions of sheer emptiness.</p>

<p>Quite as important, from the economic point of view, as the
reconciliation of society to the stage, was the reorganization
of the mechanism of theatrical life in the provinces which took
place between 1865 and 1875. From the Restoration to the
middle of the 19th century the system of &ldquo;stock companies&rdquo;
had been universal. Every great town in the three kingdoms
had its established theatre with a resident company, playing
the &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; repertory, and competing, often by illegitimate
means, for the possession of new London successes. The smaller
towns, and even villages, were grouped into local &ldquo;circuits,&rdquo;
each served by one manager with his troupe of strollers. The
&ldquo;circuits&rdquo; supplied actors to the resident stock companies,
and the stock companies served as nurseries to the patent
theatres in London. Metropolitan &ldquo;stars&rdquo; travelled from one
country theatre to another, generally alone, sometimes with
one or two subordinates in their train, and were &ldquo;supported,&rdquo;
as the phrase went, by the stock company of each theatre. Under
this system, scenery, costumes and appointments were often
grotesquely inadequate, and performances almost always rough
and unfinished. On the other hand, the constant practice in a
great number and variety of characters afforded valuable training
for actors, and developed many remarkable talents. As a source
of revenue to authors, the provinces were practically negligible.
Stageright was unprotected by law; and even if it had been
protected, it is doubtful whether authors could have got any
considerable fees out of country managers, whose precarious
ventures usually left them a small enough margin of profit.</p>

<p>The spread of railways throughout the country gradually put
an end to this system. The &ldquo;circuits&rdquo; disappeared early in the
&rsquo;fifties, the stock companies survived until about the middle
of the &rsquo;seventies. As soon as it was found easy to transport
whole companies, and even great quantities of scenery, from
theatre to theatre throughout the length and breadth of Great
Britain, it became apparent that the rough makeshifts of the
stock company system were doomed. Here again we can trace
to the old Prince of Wales&rsquo;s theatre the first distinct impulse
towards the new order of things. Robertson&rsquo;s comedies not only
encouraged but absolutely required a style of art, in mounting,
stage-management and acting, not to be found in the country
theatres. To entrust them to the stock companies was well-nigh
impossible. On the other hand, to quote Sir Squire Bancroft,
&ldquo;perhaps no play was ever better suited than <i>Caste</i> to a travelling
company; the parts being few, the scenery and dresses quite
simple, and consequently the expenses very much reduced.&rdquo;
In 1867, then, a company was organized and rehearsed in London
to carry round the provincial theatres as exact a reproduction
as possible of the London performance of <i>Caste</i> and Robertson&rsquo;s
other comedies. The smoothness of the representation, the
delicacy of the interplay among the characters, were new to
provincial audiences, and the success was remarkable. About
the same time the whole Haymarket company, under Buckstone&rsquo;s
management, began to make frequent rounds of the country
theatres; and other &ldquo;touring combinations&rdquo; were soon organized.
It is manifest that the &ldquo;combination&rdquo; system and the stock
company system cannot long coexist, for a manager cannot
afford to keep a stock company idle while a London combination
is occupying his theatre. The stock companies, therefore, soon
dwindled away, and were probably quite extinct before the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page535" id="page535"></a>535</span>
of the &rsquo;seventies. Under the present system, no sooner is a play
an established success in London than it is reproduced in one,
two or three exact copies and sent round the provincial theatres
(and the numerous suburban theatres which have sprung up
since 1895), Company A serving first-class towns, Company B
the second-class towns, and so forth. The process is very like
that of taking plaster casts of a statue, and the provincial
companies often stand to their London originals very much in
the relation of plaster to marble. Even the London scenery is
faithfully reproduced in material of extra strength, to stand the
wear-and-tear of constant removal. The result is that, instead
of the square pegs in round holes of the old stock company
system, provincial audiences now see pegs carefully adjusted
to the particular holes they occupy, and often incapable of fitting
any other. Instead of the rough performances of old, they are
now accustomed to performances of a mechanical and soulless
smoothness.</p>

<p>In some ways the gain in this respect is undeniable, in other
ways the loss is great. The provinces are no longer, in any
effective sense, a nursery of fresh talents for the London theatres,
for the art acquired in touring combinations is that of mimicry
rather than of acting. Moreover, provincial playgoers have lost
all personal interest and pride in their local theatres, which have
no longer any individuality of their own, but serve as a mere
frame for the presentation of a series of ready-made London
pictures. Christmas pantomime is the only theatrical product
that has any really local flavour in it, and even this is often only
a second-hand London production, touched up with a few
topical allusions. Again, the railways which bring London productions
to the country take country playgoers by the thousand
to London. The wealthier classes, in the Lancashire, Yorkshire
and Midland towns at any rate, do almost all their theatre-going
in London, or during the autumn months when the leading
London companies go on tour. Thus the better class of comedy
and drama has a hard fight to maintain itself in the provinces,
and the companies devoted to melodrama and musical farce
enjoy an ominous preponderance of popularity.</p>

<p>On the whole, however&mdash;and this is the main point to be
observed with regard to the literary development of the drama&mdash;the
economic movement of the five- and twenty years between
1865 and 1890 was enormously to the advantage of the dramatic
author. A London success meant a long series of full houses at
high prices, on which he took a handsome percentage. The
provinces, in which a popular playwright would often have
three or four plays going the rounds simultaneously, became a
steady source of income. And, finally, it was found possible,
even before international copyright came into force, to protect
stageright in the United States, so that about the beginning of
the &rsquo;eighties large receipts began to pour in from America. Thus
successful dramatists, instead of living from hand to mouth, like
their predecessors of the previous generation, found themselves
in comfortable and even opulent circumstances. They had
leisure for reading, thought and careful composition, and they
could afford to gratify their ambition with an occasional artistic
experiment. Failure might mean a momentary loss of prestige,
but it would not spell ruin. A distinctly progressive spirit, then,
began to animate the leading English dramatists&mdash;a spirit which
found intelligent sympathy in such managers as John Hare,
George Alexander, Beerbohm Tree and Charles Wyndham.
Nor must it be forgotten that, though the laws of literary
property, internal and international, remained far from perfect,
it was found possible to print and publish plays without incurring
loss of stageright either at home or in America. The playwrights
of the present generation have accordingly a motive for giving
literary form and polish to their work which was quite inoperative
with their predecessors, whose productions were either kept
jealously in manuscript or printed only in miserable and totally
unreadable stage editions. It is no small stimulus to ambition
to know that even if a play prove to be in advance of the standards
of taste or thought among the public to which it is originally
presented, it will not perish utterly, but will, if it have any
inherent vitality, continue to live as literature.</p>

<p>Having now summed up the economic conditions which made
for progress, let us glance at certain intellectual influences which
tended in the same direction. The establishment
of the Théâtre Libre in Paris, towards the close of 1887,
<span class="sidenote">Influence of foreign drama.</span>
unquestionably marked the beginning of a period of
restless experiment throughout the theatrical world of
Europe. A. Antoine and his supporters were in open rebellion
against the artificial methods of Scribe and the Second Empire
playwrights. Their effort was to transfer to the stage the
realism, the so-called &ldquo;naturalism,&rdquo; which had been dominant
in French fiction since 1870 or earlier; and this naturalism
was doubtless, in its turn, the outcome of the scientific movement
of the century. New methods (or ideals) of observation, and new
views as to the history and destiny of the race, could not fail to
produce a profound effect upon art; and though the modern
theatre is a cumbrous contrivance, slow to adjust its orientation
to the winds of the spirit, even it at last began to revolve, like a
rusty windmill, so as to fill its sails in the main current of the
intellectual atmosphere. Within three or four years of its
inception, Antoine&rsquo;s experiment had been imitated in Germany,
England and America. The &ldquo;Freie Bühne&rdquo; of Berlin came
into existence in 1889, the Independent Theatre of London in
1891. Similar enterprises were set on foot in Munich and other
cities. In America several less formal experiments of a like
nature were attempted, chiefly in Boston and New York. Nor
must it be forgotten that in Paris itself the Théâtre Libre did
not stand alone. Many other <i>théâtres à côté</i> sprang up, under
such titles as &ldquo;Théâtre d&rsquo;Art,&rdquo; &ldquo;Théâtre Moderne,&rdquo; &ldquo;Théâtre
de l&rsquo;Avenir Dramatique.&rdquo; The most important and least
ephemeral was the &ldquo;Théâtre de l&rsquo;&OElig;uvre,&rdquo; founded in 1893 by
Alex. Lugné-Poë, which represented mainly, though not exclusively,
the symbolist reaction against naturalism.</p>

<p>The impulse which led to the establishment of the Théâtre
Libre was, in the first instance, entirely French. If any foreign
influence helped to shape its course, it was that of the great
Russian novelists. Tolstoi&rsquo;s <i>Puissance des ténèbres</i> was the only
&ldquo;exotic&rdquo; play announced in Antoine&rsquo;s opening manifesto.
But the whole movement was soon to receive a potent stimulus
from the Norwegian poet Henrik Ibsen.</p>

<p>Ibsen&rsquo;s early romantic plays had been known in Germany
since 1875. In 1878 <i>Pillars of Society</i> and in 1880 <i>A Doll&rsquo;s
House</i> achieved wide popularity, and held the German stage
side by side with <i>A Bankruptcy</i>, by Björnstjerne Björnson.
But these plays had little influence on the German drama.
Their methods were, indeed, not essentially different from those
of the French school of the Second Empire, which were then
dominant in Germany as well as everywhere else. It was <i>Ghosts</i>
(acted in Augsburg and Meiningen 1886, in Berlin 1887) that gave
the impulse which, coalescing with the kindred impulse from
the French Théâtre Libre, was destined in the course of a few
years to create a new dramatic literature in Germany. During
the middle decades of the century Germany had produced some
dramatists of solid and even remarkable talent, such as Friedrich
Hebbel, Heinrich Laube, Karl Gutzkow and Gustav Freytag.
Even the generation which held the stage after 1870, and included
Paul Heyse, Paul Lindau and Adolf Wilbrandt, with
numerous writers of light comedy and farce, such as E. Wichert,
O. Blumenthal, G. von Moser, A. L&rsquo;Arronge and F. von Schönthan,
had produced a good many works of some merit. But, in
the main, French artificiality and frivolity predominated on
the German stage. In point of native talent and originality,
the Austrian popular playwright Ludwig Anzengruber was well
ahead of his North German contemporaries. It was in 1889,
with the establishment of the Berlin Freie Bühne, that the
reaction definitely set in. In Berlin, as afterwards in London,
<i>Ghosts</i> was the first play produced on the outpost stage, but it
was followed in Berlin by a very rapid development of native
talent. Less than a month after the performance of Ibsen&rsquo;s
play, Gerhart Hauptmann came to the front with <i>Vor Sonnenaufgang</i>,
an immature piece of almost unrelieved Zolaism,
which he soon followed up, however, with much more important
works. In <i>Das Friedensfest</i> (1890) and <i>Einsame Menschen</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page536" id="page536"></a>536</span>
(1891) he transferred his allegiance from Zola to Ibsen. His
true originality first manifested itself in <i>Die Weber</i> (1892);
and subsequently he produced plays in several different styles,
all bearing the stamp of a potent individuality. His most popular
productions have been the dramatic poems <i>Hannele</i> and <i>Die
versunkene Glocke</i>, the low-life comedy <i>Der Biberpelz</i>, and the
low-life tragedy <i>Fuhrmann Henschel</i>. Other remarkable playwrights
belonging to the Freie Bühne group are Max Halbe
(b. 1865), author of <i>Jugend</i> and <i>Mutter Erde</i>, and Otto Erich
Hartleben (b. 1864), author of <i>Hanna Jagert</i> and <i>Rosenmontag</i>.
These young men, however, so quickly gained the ear of the
general public, that the need for a special &ldquo;free stage&rdquo; was no
longer felt, and the Freie Bühne, having done its work, ceased
to exist. Unlike the French Théâtre Libre and the English
Independent theatre, it had been supported from the outset by
the most influential critics, and had won the day almost without
a battle. The productions of the new school soon made their
way even into some of the subventioned theatres; but it was the
unsubventioned Deutsches Theater of Berlin that most vigorously
continued the tradition of the Freie Bühne. One or two playwrights
of the new generation, however, did not actually belong
to the Freie Bühne group. Hermann Sudermann produced his
first play, <i>Die Ehre</i>, in 1888, and his most famous work, <i>Heimat</i>,
in 1892. In him the influence of Ibsen is very clearly perceptible;
while Arthur Schnitzler of Vienna, author of <i>Liebelei</i>, may rather
be said to derive his inspiration from the Parisian &ldquo;new
comedy.&rdquo; Originality, verging sometimes on abnormality,
distinguishes the work of Frank Wedekind (b. 1864), author
of <i>Erdgeist</i> and <i>Frühlingserwachen</i>. Hugo von Hofmannsthal
(b. 1874), in his <i>Elektra</i> and <i>Ödipus</i>, rehandles classic themes
in the light of modern anthropology and psychology.</p>

<p>The promoters of the Théâtre Libre had probably never heard
of Ibsen when they established that institution, but three years
later his fame had reached France, and <i>Les Revenants</i> was produced
by the Théâtre Libre (29th May 1890). Within the next
two or three years almost all his modern plays were acted in
Paris, most of them either by the Théâtre Libre or by L&rsquo;&OElig;uvre.
Close upon the heels of the Ibsen influence followed another,
less potent, but by no means negligible. The exquisite tragic
symbolism of Maurice Maeterlinck began to find numerous
admirers about 1890. In 1891 his one-act play <i>L&rsquo;Intruse</i> was
acted; in 1893, <i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i>. By this time, too, the
reverberation of the impulse which the Théâtre Libre had given
to the Freie Bühne began to be felt in France. In 1893 Hauptmann&rsquo;s
<i>Die Weber</i> was acted in Paris, and, being frequently
repeated, made a deep and lasting impression.</p>

<p>The English analogue to the Théâtre Libre, the Independent
theatre, opened its first season (March 13, 1891) with a performance
of <i>Ghosts</i>. This was not, however, the first introduction
of Ibsen to the English stage. On the 7th of June 1889 (six weeks
after the production of <i>The Profligate</i>) <i>A Doll&rsquo;s House</i> was acted
at the Novelty theatre, and ran for three weeks, amid a storm
of critical controversy. In the same year <i>Pillars of Society</i> was
presented in London. In 1891 and 1892 <i>A Doll&rsquo;s House</i> was
frequently acted; <i>Rosmersholm</i> was produced in 1891, and
again in 1893; in May and June 1891 <i>Hedda Gabler</i> had a run
of several weeks; and early in 1893 <i>The Master Builder</i> enjoyed a
similar passing vogue. During these years, then, Ibsen was very
much &ldquo;in the air&rdquo; in England, as well as in France and Germany.
The Independent theatre, in the meantime, under the management
of J. T. Grein, found but scanty material to deal with. It
presented translations of Zola&rsquo;s <i>Thérèse Raquin</i>, and of <i>A Visit</i>,
by the Danish dramatist Edward Brandes; but it brought to
the front only one English author of any note, in the person
of George Bernard Shaw, whose &ldquo;didactic realistic play,&rdquo;
<i>Widowers&rsquo; Houses</i>, it produced in December 1892.</p>

<p>None the less is it true that the ferment of fresh energy, which
between 1887 and 1893 had created a new dramatic literature
both in France and in Germany, was distinctly felt in England as
well. England did not take at all kindly to it. The productions
of Ibsen&rsquo;s plays, in particular, were received with an outcry of
reprobation. A great part of this clamour was due to sheer
misunderstanding; but some of it, no doubt, arose from genuine
and deep-seated distaste. As for the dramatists of recognized
standing, they one and all, both from policy and from conviction,
adopted a hostile attitude towards Ibsen, expressing at most
a theoretical respect overborne by practical dislike. Yet his
influence permeated the atmosphere. He had revealed possibilities
of technical stagecraft and psychological delineation
that, once realized, were not to be banished from the mind of
the thoughtful playwright. They haunted him in spite of
himself. Still subtler was the influence exerted over the critics
and the more intelligent public. Deeply and genuinely as many
of them disliked Ibsen&rsquo;s works, they found, when they returned
to the old-fashioned play, the adapted frivolity or the homegrown
sentimentalism, that they disliked this still more. On
every side, then, there was an instinctive or deliberate reaching
forward towards something new; and once again it was Pinero
who ventured the decisive step.</p>

<p>On the 27th of May 1893 <i>The Second Mrs Tanqueray</i> was
produced at the St James&rsquo;s theatre. With <i>The Second Mrs
Tanqueray</i> the English acted drama ceased to be a merely insular
product, and took rank in the literature of Europe. Here
was a play which, whatever its faults, was obviously comparable
with the plays of Dumas, of Sudermann, of Björnson, of Echegaray.
It might be better than some of these plays, worse than others;
but it stood on the same artistic level. The fact that such a
play could not only be produced, but could brilliantly succeed,
on the London stage gave a potent stimulus to progress. It
encouraged ambition in authors, enterprise in managers. What
<i>Hernani</i> was to the romantic movement of the &rsquo;thirties, and
<i>La Dame aux camélias</i> to the realistic movement of the &rsquo;fifties,
<i>The Second Mrs Tanqueray</i> was to the movement of the &rsquo;nineties
towards the serious stage-portraiture of English social life.
All the forces which we have been tracing&mdash;Robertsonian realism
of externals, the leisure for thought and experiment involved
in vastly improved financial conditions, the substitution in France
of a simpler, subtler technique for the outworn artifices of the
Scribe school, and the electric thrill communicated to the whole
theatrical life of Europe by contact with the genius of Ibsen&mdash;all
these slowly converging forces coalesced to produce, in <i>The
Second Mrs Tanqueray</i>, an epoch-marking play.</p>

<p>Pinero followed up <i>Mrs Tanqueray</i> with a remarkable series
of plays&mdash;<i>The Notorious Mrs Ebbsmith</i>, <i>The Benefit of the Doubt</i>,
<i>The Princess and the Butterfly</i>, <i>Trelawny of the &ldquo;Wells</i>,&rdquo; <i>The
Gay Lord Quex</i>, <i>Iris</i>, <i>Letty</i>, <i>His House in Order</i> and <i>The Thunderbolt</i>&mdash;all
of which show marked originality of conception and
intellectual force. In January 1893 Charles Wyndham initiated
a new policy at the Criterion theatre, and produced an original
play, <i>The Bauble-Shop</i>, by Henry Arthur Jones. It belonged
very distinctly to the pre-Tanqueray order of things; but the
same author&rsquo;s <i>The Case of Rebellious Susan</i>, in the following year,
showed an almost startlingly sudden access of talent, which was
well maintained in such later works as <i>Michael and his Lost
Angel</i> (1896), that admirable comedy <i>The Liars</i> (1897), and
<i>Mrs Dane&rsquo;s Defence</i> (1900). Sydney Grundy produced after
1893 by far his most important original works, <i>The Greatest of
These</i> (1896) and <i>The Debt of Honour</i> (1900). R. C. Carton,
breaking away from the somewhat laboured sentimentalism of his
earlier manner, produced several light comedies of thoroughly
original humour and of excellent literary workmanship&mdash;<i>Lord
and Lady Algy</i>, <i>Wheels within Wheels</i>, <i>Lady Huntworth&rsquo;s Experiment</i>,
<i>Mr Hopkinson</i> and <i>Mr Preedy and the Countess</i>.
Haddon Chambers, in <i>The Tyranny of Tears</i> (1899) and <i>The
Awakening</i> (1901), produced two plays of a merit scarcely foreshadowed
in his earlier efforts.</p>

<p>What was of more importance, a new generation of playwrights
came to the front. Its most notable representatives
were J. M. Barrie, who displayed his inexhaustible gift of humorous
observation and invention in <i>Quality Street</i> (1902), <i>The
Admirable Crichton</i> (1903), <i>Little Mary</i> (1903), <i>Peter Pan</i> (1904),
<i>Alice Sit-by-the-Fire</i> (1905) and <i>What Every Woman Knows</i>
(1908); Mrs Craigie (&ldquo;John Oliver Hobbes&rdquo;), who produced in
<i>The Ambassador</i> (1898) a comedy of fine accomplishment;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page537" id="page537"></a>537</span>
and H. V. Esmond, Alfred Sutro, Hubert Henry Davies, W. S.
Maugham, Rudolf Besier, Roy Horniman and J. B. Fagan.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the efforts to relieve the drama from the pressure
of the long-run system had not been confined to the Independent
theatre. Several other enterprises of a like nature had proved
more or less short-lived; but the Stage Society, founded in 1900,
was conducted with more energy and perseverance, and became
a real force in the dramatic world. After two seasons devoted
mainly to Bernard Shaw, Ibsen, Maeterlinck and Hauptmann,
it produced in its third season <i>The Marrying of Ann Leete</i>, by
Granville Barker (b. 1877), who had developed in its service his
remarkable gifts as a producer of plays. A year or two later,
Barker staged for another organization, the New Century
theatre, Professor Gilbert Murray&rsquo;s rendering of the <i>Hippolytus</i>
of Euripides; and it was partly the success of this production
that suggested the Vedrenne-Barker partnership at the Court
theatre, which, between 1904 and 1907, gave an extraordinary impulse
to the intellectual life of the theatre. Adopting the &ldquo;short-run&rdquo;
system, as a compromise between the long-run and the
repertory systems, the Vedrenne-Barker management made the
plays of Bernard Shaw (both old and new) for the first time really
popular. Of the plays already published <i>You Never Can Tell</i>
and <i>Man and Superman</i> were the most successful; of the new
plays, <i>John Bull&rsquo;s Other Island</i>, <i>Major Barbara</i> and <i>The Doctor&rsquo;s
Dilemma</i>. But though Shaw was the mainstay of the enterprise,
it gave opportunities to several other writers, the most
notable being John Galsworthy (b. 1867), author of <i>The Silver
Box</i> and <i>Strife</i>, St John Hankin (1869-1909), author of <i>The
Return of the Prodigal</i> and <i>The Charity that began at Home</i>, and
Granville Barker himself, whose plays <i>The Voysey Inheritance</i>
and <i>Waste</i> (1907) were among the most important products of
this movement. It should also be noted that the production
of the <i>Hippolytus</i> was followed up by the production of the
<i>Trojan Women</i>, the <i>Electra</i> and the <i>Medea</i> of Euripides, all
translated by Gilbert Murray.</p>

<p>The impulse to which were due the Independent theatre, the
Stage Society and the Vedrenne-Barker management, combined
with local influences to bring about the foundation in Dublin
of the Irish National theatre. Its moving spirit was the poet
W. B. Yeats (b. 1865), who wrote for it <i>Cathleen-ni-Hoolihan</i>, <i>The
Hour-Glass</i>, <i>The King&rsquo;s Threshold</i> and one or two other plays.
Lady Gregory, Padraic Collum, Boyle and other authors also
contributed to the repertory of this admirable little theatre; but
its most notable products were the plays of J. M. Synge (1871-1909),
whose <i>Riders to the Sea</i>, <i>Well of the Saints</i> and <i>Playboy
of the Western World</i> showed a fine and original dramatic faculty
combined with extraordinary beauty of style.</p>

<p>Both in Manchester and in Glasgow endeavours have been
made, with considerable success, to counteract the evils of the
touring system, by the establishment of resident companies
acting the better class of modern plays on a &ldquo;short-run&rdquo; plan,
similar to that of the Vedrenne-Barker management. The
Manchester enterprise was to some extent subsidized by Miss E.
Horniman, and may therefore claim to be the first endowed
theatre in England. The need for endowment on a much larger
scale was, however, strongly advocated in the early years of the
20th century by the more progressive supporters of English
drama, and in 1908 found a place in the scheme for a Shakespeare
National theatre, which was then superimposed on the earlier
proposal for a memorial commemorating the Shakespeare
tercentenary, organized by an influential committee under the
chairmanship of the Lord Mayor of London. The scheme
involved the raising of £500,000, half to be devoted to the
requisite site and building, while the remainder would be invested
so as to furnish an annual subvention.</p>

<p>It remains to say a few words of the English literary drama,
as opposed to the acted drama. The two classes are not nearly
so distinct as they once were; but plays continue to be produced
from time to time which are wholly unfitted for the theatre,
and others which, though they may be experimentally placed
on the stage, make their appeal rather to the reading public.
Tennyson had essayed in his old age an art which is scarcely
to be mastered after the energy of youth has passed. He continued
to the last to occupy himself more or less with drama,
and all his plays, except <i>Harold</i>, found their way to the stage.
<i>The Cup</i> and <i>Becket</i>, as we have seen, met with a certain success,
but <i>The Promise of May</i> (1882), an essay in contemporary drama,
was a disastrous failure, while <i>The Falcon</i> (1879) and <i>The
Foresters</i> (acted by an American company in 1893) made little
impression. Lord Tennyson was certainly not lacking in dramatic
faculty, but he worked in an outworn form which he had no
longer the strength to renovate. Swinburne continued now and
then to cast his creations in the dramatic mould, but it cannot
be said that his dramas attained either the vitality or the popularity
of his lyrical poems. <i>Mary Stuart</i> (1881) brought his
Marian trilogy to a close. In <i>Locrine</i> he produced a tragedy in
heroic couplets&mdash;a thing probably unattempted since the age
of Dryden. <i>The Sisters</i> is a tragedy of modern date with a
medieval drama inserted by way of interlude. <i>Rosamund,
Queen of the Lombards</i> (1899), perhaps approached more nearly
than any of his former works to the concentration essential to
drama. It may be doubted, however, whether his copious and
ebullient style could ever really subject itself to the trammels of
dramatic form. Of other dramas on the Elizabethan model,
the most notable, perhaps, were the works of two ladies who
adopt the pseudonym of &ldquo;Michael Field&rdquo;; <i>Callirrhoë</i> (1884),
<i>Brutus Ultor</i> (1887), and many other dramas, show considerable
power of imagination and expression, but are burdened by a
deliberate artificiality both of technique and style. Alfred Austin
put forth several volumes in dramatic form, such as <i>Savonarola</i>
(1881), <i>Prince Lucifer</i> (1887), <i>England&rsquo;s Darling</i> (1896), <i>Flodden
Field</i> (1905). They are laudable in intention and fluent in
utterance. Notable additions to the purely literary drama were
made by Robert Bridges in his <i>Prometheus</i> (1883), <i>Nero</i> (1885),
<i>The Feast of Bacchus</i> (1889), and other solid plays in verse, full
of science and skill, but less charming than his lyrical poems.
Sir Lewis Morris made a dramatic experiment in <i>Gycia</i>, but was
not encouraged to repeat it.</p>

<p>From the outset of his career, John Davidson (1857-1909) was
haunted by the conviction that he was a born dramatist; but
his earlier plays, such as <i>Smith: a Tragedy</i> (1886), <i>Bruce: a
Chronicle Play</i> (1884) and <i>Scaramouch in Naxos</i> (1888), contained
more poetry than drama; and his later pieces, such as <i>Self&rsquo;s
the Man</i> (1901), <i>The Theatrocrat</i> (1905) and the <i>Triumph of
Mammon</i> (1907), showed a species of turbulent imagination,
but became more and more fantastic and impracticable.
Stephen Phillips (b. 1867), on the other hand, having had some
experience as an actor, wrote always with the stage in view.
In his first play, <i>Paolo and Francesca</i> (1899; produced in 1902),
he succeeded in combining great beauty of diction with intense
dramatic power and vitality. The same may be said of <i>Herod</i>
(1900); but in <i>Ulysses</i> (1902) and <i>Nero</i> (1906) a great falling-off
in constructive power was only partially redeemed by the
fine inspiration of individual passages.</p>

<p>The collaboration of Robert Louis Stevenson with William
Ernest Henley produced a short series of interesting experiments
in drama, two of which, <i>Beau Austin</i> (1883) and <i>Admiral Guinea</i>
(1884), had more than a merely experimental value. The
former was an emotional comedy, treating with rare distinction
of touch a difficult, almost an impossible, subject; the latter was
a nautical melodrama, raised by force of imagination and diction
into the region of literature. <span class="correction" title="amended from Imcomparably">Incomparably</span> the most important
of recent additions to the literary drama is Thomas Hardy&rsquo;s
vast panorama of the Napoleonic wars, entitled <i>The Dynasts</i>
(1904-1908). It is rather an epic in dialogue than a play; but
however we may classify it we cannot but recognize its extraordinary
intellectual and imaginative powers.</p>

<p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;American dramatists have shown on their
own account a progressive tendency, quite as marked as that
which we have been tracing in England. Down to about 1890
the influence of France had been even more predominant in
America than in England. The only American dramatist of
eminence, Bronson Howard (1842-1908), was a disciple, though
a very able one, of the French school. A certain stirring of native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page538" id="page538"></a>538</span>
originality manifested itself during the &rsquo;eighties, when a series
of semi-improvised farces, associated with the names of two
actor-managers, Harrigan and Hart, depicted low life in New
York with real observation, though in a crude and formless
manner. About the same time a native style of popular melodrama
began to make its appearance&mdash;a play of conventional and
negligible plot, which attracted by reason of one or more faithfully
observed character-types, generally taken from country
life. <i>The Old Homestead</i>, written by Denman Thompson, who
himself acted in it, was the most popular play of this class.
Rude as it was, it distinctly foreshadowed that faithfulness
to the external aspects, at any rate, of everyday life, in which
lies the strength of the native American drama. It was at a
sort of free theatre in Boston that James A. Herne (1840-1901)
produced in 1891 his realistic drama of modern life, <i>Margaret
Fleming</i>, which did a great deal to awaken the interest of literary
America in the theatrical movement. Herne, an actor and a
most accomplished stage-manager, next produced a drama of
rural life in New England, <i>Shore Acres</i> (1892), which made an
immense popular success. It was a play of the <i>Old Homestead</i>
type, but very much more coherent and artistic. His next
play, <i>Griffith Davenport</i> (1898), founded on a novel, was a drama
of life in Virginia during the Civil War, admirable in its strength
and quiet sincerity; while in his last work, <i>Sag Harbour</i> (1900),
Herne returned to the study of rustic character, this time in
Long Island. Herne showed human nature in its more obvious
and straightforward aspects, making no attempt at psychological
subtlety; but within his own limits he was an admirable craftsman.
The same preoccupation with local colour is manifest in the
plays of Augustus M. Thomas, a writer of genuine humour and
originality. His localism announces itself in the very titles of
his most popular plays&mdash;<i>Alabama</i>, <i>In Mizzoura</i>, <i>Arizona</i>. He
also made a striking success in <i>The Witching Hour</i>, a play dealing
with the phenomena of hypnotism and suggestion. Clyde Fitch
(1865-1909), an immensely prolific playwright of indubitable ability,
after becoming known by some experiments in quasi-historic
drama (notably <i>Nathan Hale</i>, 1898; <i>Barbara Frietchie</i>, 1899),
devoted himself mainly to social drama on the French model,
in which his most notable efforts have been <i>The Climbers</i> (1900),
<i>The Truth</i> (1906), and <i>The Girl with the Green Eyes</i> (1902). In
popular drama, with elaborate scenic illustration, William
Gillette (b. 1856), David Belasco (b. 1859) and Charles Klein
(b. 1867) have done notable work. William Vaughn Moody
(b. 1869) produced in <i>The Great Divide</i> (1907) a play of somewhat
higher artistic pretensions; Eugene Walter in <i>Paid in Full</i>
(1908) and <i>The Easiest Way</i> (1909) dealt vigorously with characteristic
themes of modern life; and Edward Sheldon produced in
<i>Salvation Nell</i> a slum drama of very striking realism. The poetic
side of drama was mainly represented by Percy Mackaye (b.
1875), whose <i>Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc</i> (1906) and <i>Sappho and Phaon</i> showed
a high ambition and no small literary power. On the whole it
may be said that, though the financial conditions of the American
stage are even more unfortunate than those which prevail in
England, they have failed to check a very strong movement
towards nationalism in drama. Season by season, America
writes more of her own plays, good or bad, and becomes less
dependent on imported work, whether French or English.</p>
<div class="author">(W. A.)</div>

<p class="center pt2">(g) <i>German Drama.</i></p>

<p>The history of the German drama differs widely from that
of the English, though a close contact is observable between
them at an early point, and again at relatively recent points, in
their annals. The dramatic literature of Germany, though in its
beginnings intimately connected with the great national movement
of the Reformation, soon devoted its efforts to a sterile
imitation of foreign models; while the popular stage, persistently
suiting itself to a robust but gross taste, likewise largely due to
the influence of foreign examples, seemed destined to a hopeless
decay. The literary and the acted drama were thus estranged
from one another during a period of extraordinary length;
nor was it till the middle of the 18th century that, with the
opening of a more hopeful era for the life and literature of the
nation, the reunion of dramatic literature and the stage began to
accomplish itself. Before the end of the same century the
progress of the German drama in its turn began to influence
that of other nations, and by the widely comprehensive character
of its literature, as well as by the activity of its stage, to invite a
steadily increasing interest.</p>

<p>It should be premised that in its beginnings the modern
German drama might have seemed likely to be influenced even
more largely than the English or the French by the
copious imitation of classical models which marked
<span class="sidenote">The Latin drama in Germany.</span>
the periods of the Renaissance and the Reformation;
but here the impulse of originality was wanting to
bring about a speedy and gradually a complete emancipation,
and imitative reproduction continued in an all but endless
series. The first German (and indeed the earliest transalpine)
writer to follow in the footsteps of the modern Latin drama of
the Italians was the famous Strassburg humanist Jacob
Wimpheling (1450-1528), whose comedy of <i>Stylpho</i> (1480), an
attack upon the ignorance of the pluralist beneficed clergy,
marks a kind of epoch in the history of German dramatic effort.
It was succeeded by many other Latin plays of various kinds,
among which may be mentioned J. Kerckmeister&rsquo;s <i>Codrus</i> (1485),
satirizing pedantic schoolmasters; a series of historical dramas
in a moralizing vein, partly on the Turkish peril, as well as of
comedies, by Jacob Locher (1471-1528); two plays by the great
Johann Reuchlin, of which the so-called <i>Henno</i> went through
more than thirty editions; and the <i>Ludus Dianae</i>, with another
play likewise in honour of the emperor Maximilian I., by the
celebrated Viennese scholar Conrad Celtes (1459-1508). Sebastian
Brant&rsquo;s <i>Hercules in Bivio</i> (1512) is lost; but Wilibald Pirckheimer&rsquo;s
<i>Eckius dedolatus</i> (1520) survives as a dramatic contribution
to Luther&rsquo;s controversy with one of his most active opponents.
The <i>Acolastus</i> (1525) of W. Gnaphaeus (<i>alias</i> Fullonius, his
native name was de Volder) should also be mentioned in the
present connexion, as, though a Dutchman by birth, he spent
most of his literary life in Germany. This Terentian version of
the parable of the Prodigal Son was printed in an almost endless
number of editions, as well as in various versions in modern
tongues, among which reference has already been made to the
English, for the use of schools, by J. Palsgrave (1540). Macropedius
(Langhveldt) belongs wholly to the Low Countries. In
Germany the stream of these compositions continued to flow
almost without abatement throughout the earlier half of the
16th century; but in the days of the Reformation it takes a
turn to scriptural subjects, and during the latter part of the
century remains on the whole faithful to this preference.<a name="fa273a" id="fa273a" href="#ft273a"><span class="sp">273</span></a> These
Latin plays may be called school-dramas in the most precise
sense; for they were both performed in the schools and read
in class with commentaries specially composed for them; nor
was it except very reluctantly that in this age the vernacular
drama was allowed to intrude into scholastic circles. It should
be noticed that the Jesuit order, which afterwards proved so
<span class="sidenote">The Jesuit drama.</span>
keenly alive to the influence which dramatic performances
exercise over the youthful mind, only
very gradually abandoned the principle, formally
sanctioned in their <i>Ratio studiorum</i>, that the acting of plays
(these being always in the Latin tongue) should only rarely be
permitted in their seminaries. The flourishing period of the
Jesuit drama begins with the spread of the order in the west
and south-west of the Empire in the last decade of the 16th
century, and then continues, through the vicissitudes of good
and evil, with a curious intermixture of Latin and German
plays, during the whole of the 17th and the better part of the
18th. These productions, which ranged in their subjects from
biblical and classical story to themes of contemporary history
(such as the relief of Vienna by Sobiesky and the peace of Ryswick),
seem generally to bear the mark of their authorship&mdash;that
of teachers appointed by their superiors to execute this among
other tasks allotted to them; but, as it seems unnecessary to
return to this special growth, it may be added that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page539" id="page539"></a>539</span>
extraordinary productiveness of the Jesuit dramatists, and the
steadiness of self-repetition which is equally characteristic of
them, should warn us against underrating its influence upon a
considerable proportion of the nation&rsquo;s educational life during a
long succession of generations.</p>

<p>While the scholars of the German Renaissance, who became
so largely the agents of the Reformation, eagerly dramatized
scriptural subjects in the Latin, and sometimes (as in
the case of Luther&rsquo;s protégé P. Rebhun<a name="fa274a" id="fa274a" href="#ft274a"><span class="sp">274</span></a>) in the native
<span class="sidenote">Beginnings of the vernacular German drama.</span>
tongue, the same influence made itself felt in another
sphere of dramatic activity. Towards the close of the
middle ages, as has been seen, dramatic performances
had in Germany, as in England, largely fallen into the hands of
the civic gilds, and the composition of plays was more especially
cultivated by the master-singers of Nuremberg and other towns.
It was thus that, under the influence of the Reformation, and of
the impulse given by Luther and others to the use of High
German as the popular literary tongue, Hans Sachs, the immortal
<span class="sidenote">Hans Sachs.</span>
shoemaker of Nuremberg, seemed destined to become
the father of the popular German drama. In his
plays, &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; &ldquo;secular,&rdquo; and <i>Fastnachtsspiele</i>
alike, the interest indeed lies in the dialogue rather than in the
action, nor do they display any attempt at development of
character. In their subjects, whether derived from Scripture
or from popular legend and fiction,<a name="fa275a" id="fa275a" href="#ft275a"><span class="sp">275</span></a> there is no novelty, and in
their treatment no originality. But the healthy vigour and
fresh humour of this marvellously fertile author, and his innate
sympathy with the views and sentiments of the burgher class
to which he belonged, were elements of genuine promise&mdash;a
promise which the event was signally to disappoint. Though
the manner of Hans Sachs found a few followers, and is recognizable
in the German popular drama even of the beginning of the
17th century, the literature of the Reformation, of which his
works may claim to form part, was soon absorbed in labours of
a very different kind. The stage, after admitting novelties
introduced from Italy or (under Jesuit supervision) from Spain,
was subjected to another and enduring influence. Among the
foreign actors of various nations who flitted through the innumerable
<span class="sidenote">The English comedians.</span>
courts of the empire, or found a temporary
home there, special prominence was acquired, towards
the close of the 16th and in the early years of the 17th
century, by the &ldquo;English comedians,&rdquo; who appeared
at Cassel, Wolfenbuttel, Berlin, Dresden, Cologne, &amp;c. Through
these players a number of early English dramas found their way
into Germany, where they were performed in more or less
imperfect versions, and called forth imitations by native authors.
Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick-Luneburg<a name="fa276a" id="fa276a" href="#ft276a"><span class="sp">276</span></a> (1564-1613) and
Jacob Ayrer (a citizen of Nuremberg, where he died, 1605)
represent the endeavours of the early German drama to suit its
still uncouth forms to themes suggested by English examples;
and in their works, and in those of contemporary playwrights,
there reappears no small part of what we may conclude to have
been the &ldquo;English comedians&rsquo;&rdquo; <i>répertoire</i>.<a name="fa277a" id="fa277a" href="#ft277a"><span class="sp">277</span></a> (The converse
influence of German themes brought home with them by the
English actors, or set in motion by their strolling ubiquity,
cannot have been equal in extent, though Shakespeare himself
may have derived the idea of one of his plots<a name="fa278a" id="fa278a" href="#ft278a"><span class="sp">278</span></a> from such a
source). But, though welcome to both princes and people, the
exertions of these foreign comedians, and of the native imitators
who soon arose in the earliest professional companies of actors
known in Germany, instead of bringing about a union between
the stage and literature, led to a directly opposite result. The
popularity of these strollers was owing partly to the (very real)
blood and other horrors with which their plays were deluged,
partly to the buffoonery with which they seasoned, and the
various tricks and feats with which they diversified, their performances.
The representatives of the English clowns had
learnt much on their way from their brethren in the Netherlands,
where in this period the art of grotesque acting greatly flourished.
Nor were the aids of other arts neglected,&mdash;to this day in Germany
professors of the &ldquo;equestrian drama&rdquo; are known by the popular
appellation of &ldquo;English riders.&rdquo; From these true descendants
of the mimes, then, the professional actors in Germany inherited
a variety of tricks and traditions; and soon the favourite
figures of the popular comic stage became conventional, and
were stereotyped by the use of masks. Among these an acknowledged
supremacy was acquired by the native <i>Hans Wurst</i>
(Jack Pudding)&mdash;of whose name Luther disavowed the invention,
and who is known already to Hans Sachs&mdash;the privileged buffoon,
and for a long series of generations the real lord and master, of
the German stage. If that stage, with its grossness and ribaldry,
<span class="sidenote">Separation between the stage and literature.</span>
seemed likely to become permanently estranged from
the tastes and sympathies of the educated classes,
the fault was by no means entirely its own and that
of its patron the populace. The times were evil times
for a national effort of any kind; and poetic literature
was in all its branches passing into the hands of scholars who
were often pedants, and whose language was a jargon of learned
affectations. Thus things continued, till the awful visitation
of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War cast a general blight upon the national
life, and the traditions of the popular theatre were left to the
guardianship of the marionettes (<i>Puppenspiele</i>)!</p>

<p>When, in the midst of that war, German poets once more
began to essay the dramatic form, the national drama was left
outside their range of vision. M. Opitz, who holds an
honoured place in the history of the German language
<span class="sidenote">The literary drama of the 17th century.</span>
and literature, in this branch of his labours contented
himself with translations of classical dramas and of
Italian pastorals&mdash;among the latter one of Rinuccini&rsquo;s
<i>Daphne</i>, with which the history of the opera in Germany begins.
A. Gryphius, though as a comic dramatist lacking neither vigour
nor variety, and acquainted with Shakespearian<a name="fa279a" id="fa279a" href="#ft279a"><span class="sp">279</span></a> as well as Latin
and Italian examples, chiefly devoted himself to the imitation
of Latin, earlier French, and Dutch tragedy, the rhetorical
dialogue of which he effectively reproduced in the Alexandrine
metre.<a name="fa280a" id="fa280a" href="#ft280a"><span class="sp">280</span></a> Neither the turgid dramas of D. C. von Lohenstein
(1665-1684), for whose <i>Cleopatra</i> the honour of having been the
first German tragedy has been claimed, nor even the much
healthier comedies of Chr. Weise (1642-1708) were brought upon
the stage; while the religious plays of J. Klay (1616-1656) are
mere recitations connected with the Italian growth of the
<i>oratorio</i>. The frigid allegories commemorative of contemporary
events, with which the learned from time to time supplied the
theatre, and the pastoral dramas with which the idyllic poets of
Nuremberg&mdash;&ldquo;the shepherds of the Pegnitz&rdquo;&mdash;after the close of
the war gratified the peaceful longings of their fellow-citizens,
were alike mere scholastic efforts. These indeed continued in
the universities and <i>gymnasia</i> to keep alive the love of both
dramatic composition and dramatic representation, and to
encourage the theatrical taste which led so many students into
the professional companies. But neither these dramatic exercises
nor the <i>ludi Caesarei</i> in which the Jesuits at Vienna revived
the pomp and pageantry, and the mixture of classical and
Christian symbolism, of the Italian Renaissance, had any influence
upon the progress of the popular drama.</p>

<p>The history of the German stage remains to about the second
decennium of the 18th century one of the most melancholy,
as it is in its way one of the most instructive, chapters
of theatrical history. Ignored by the world of letters,
<span class="sidenote">The stage before its reform.</span>
the actors in return deliberately sought to emancipate
their art from all dependence upon literary material.
Improvisation reigned supreme, not only in farce, where <i>Hans
Wurst</i>, with the aid of Italian examples, never ceased to charm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page540" id="page540"></a>540</span>
his public, but in the serious drama likewise (in which, however,
he also played his part) in those <i>Haupt- und Staatsactionen</i> (high-matter-of-state-dramas),
the plots of which were taken from
the old stores of the English comedians, from the religious drama
and its sources, and from the profane history of all times. The
hero of this period is &ldquo;Magister&rdquo; J. Velthen (or Veltheim),
who at the head of a company of players for a time entered the
service of the Saxon court, and, by reproducing comedies of
Molière and other writers, sought to restrain the licence which he
had himself carried beyond all earlier precedent, but who had
to fall back into the old ways and the old life. His career exhibits
the climax of the efforts of the art of acting to stand alone;
after his death (c. 1693) chaos ensues. The strolling companies,
which now included actresses, continued to foster the popular
love of the stage, and even under its most degraded form to uphold
its national character against the rivalry of the opera, and that of
the Italian <i>commedia dell&rsquo; arte</i>. From the latter was borrowed
Harlequin, with whom <i>Hans Wurst</i> was blended, and who became
a standing figure in every kind of popular play.<a name="fa281a" id="fa281a" href="#ft281a"><span class="sp">281</span></a> He established
his sway more especially at Vienna, where from about 1712 the
first permanent German theatre was maintained. But for the
actors in general there was little permanence, and amidst miseries
of all sorts, and under the growing ban of clerical intolerance,
the popular stage seemed destined to hopeless decay. A certain
vitality of growth seems, under clerical guidance, to have
characterized the plays of the people in Bavaria and parts of
Austria.</p>

<p>The first endeavours to reform what had thus apparently
passed beyond all reach of recovery were neither wholly nor
generally successful; but this does not diminish the
honour due to two names which should never be
<span class="sidenote">F. K. Neuber, Gottsched, and the Leipzig school.</span>
mentioned without respect in connexion with the
history of the drama. Friederike Karoline Neuber&rsquo;s
(1697-1760) biography is the story of a long-continued
effort which, notwithstanding errors and weaknesses,
and though, so far as her personal fortunes were concerned,
it ended in failure, may almost be described as heroic. As directress
of a company of actors which from 1727 had its headquarters
at Leipzig (hence the new school of acting is called the Leipzig
school), she resolved to put an end to the formlessness of the
existing stage, to separate tragedy and comedy, and to extinguish
Harlequin. In this endeavour she was supported by the Leipzig
professor J. Chr. Gottsched, who induced her to establish French
tragedy and comedy as the sole models of the regular drama.
Literature and the stage thus for the first time joined hands,
and no temporary mischance or personal misunderstanding can
obscure the enduring significance of the union. Not only were the
abuses of a century swept away from a representative theatre,
but a large number of literary works, designed for the stage, were
produced on it. It is true that they were but versions or imitations
from the French (or in the case of Gottsched&rsquo;s <i>Dying Cato</i>
from the French and English),<a name="fa282a" id="fa282a" href="#ft282a"><span class="sp">282</span></a> and that at the moment of the
regeneration of the German drama new fetters were thus imposed
upon it, and upon the art of acting at the same time. But the
impulse had been given, and the beginning made. On the one
hand, men of letters began to subject their dramatic compositions
to the test of performance; the tragedies and comedies of J. E.
Schlegel, the artificial and sentimental comedies of Chr. F.
Gellert and others, together with the vigorous popular comedies
of the Danish dramatist Holberg, were brought into competition
with translations from the French. On the other hand, the
<span class="sidenote">Ekhof</span>
Leipzig school exercised a continuous effect upon the
progress of the art of acting, and before long K. Ekhof
began a career which made his art a fit subject for the critical
study of scholars, and his profession one to be esteemed by
honourable men.</p>

<p>Among the authors contributing to Mme. Neuber&rsquo;s Leipzig
enterprise had been a young student destined to complete, after
a very different fashion and with very different aims, the work
which she and Gottsched had begun. The critical genius of G.
<span class="sidenote">Lessing.</span>
E. Lessing is peerless in its comprehensiveness, as in its
keenness and depth; but if there was any branch of
literature and art which by study and practice he made pre-eminently
his own, it was that of the drama. As bearing upon
the progress of the German theatre, his services to its literature,
both critical and creative, can only be described as inestimable.
The <i>Hamburgische Dramaturgie</i>, a series of criticisms of plays
and (in its earlier numbers) of actors, was undertaken in furtherance
of the attempt to establish at Hamburg the first national
German theatre (1767-1769). This fact alone would invest
these papers with a high significance; for, though the theatrical
enterprise proved abortive, it established the principle upon
which the progress of the theatre in all countries depends&mdash;that
for the dramatic art the immediate theatrical public is no
sufficient court of appeal. But the direct effect of the <i>Dramaturgie</i>
was to complete the task which Lessing had in previous
writings begun, and to overthrow the dominion of the arbitrary
French rules and the French models established by Gottsched.
Lessing vindicated its real laws to the drama, made clear the
difference between the Greeks and their would-be representatives,
and established the claims of Shakespeare as the modern master
of both tragedy and comedy. His own dramatic productivity
was cautious, tentative, progressive. His first step was, by his
<i>Miss Sara Sampson</i> (1755), to oppose the realism of the English
domestic drama to the artificiality of the accepted French
models, in the forms of which Chr. F. Weisse (1726-1804) was
seeking to treat the subjects of Shakespearian plays.<a name="fa283a" id="fa283a" href="#ft283a"><span class="sp">283</span></a> Then,
in his <i>Minna von Barnhelm</i> (1767), which owed something to
Farquhar, he essayed a national comedy drawn from real life,
and appealing to patriotic sentiments as well as to broad human
sympathies. It was written in prose (like <i>Miss Sara Sampson</i>),
but in form held a judicious mean between French and English
examples.</p>

<p>The note sounded by the criticisms of Lessing met with a
ready response, and the productivity displayed by the nascent
dramatic literature of Germany is astonishing, both
in the efforts inspired by his teachings and in those
<span class="sidenote">Efforts of the theatre and of literature.</span>
which continued to controvert or which aspired
to transcend them. On the stage, Harlequin and
his surroundings proved by no means easy to suppress,
more especially at Vienna, the favourite home of frivolous
amusement; but even here a reform was gradually effected,
and, under the intelligent rule of the emperor Joseph II., a
national stage grew into being. The mantle of Ekhof fell upon
the shoulders of his eager younger rival, F. L. Schröder, who
was the first to domesticate Shakespeare upon the German stage.
In dramatic literature few of Lessing&rsquo;s earlier contemporaries
produced any works of permanent value, unless the religious
dramas of F. G. Klopstock&mdash;a species in which he had been
preceded by J. J. Bodmer&mdash;and the patriotic <i>Bardietten</i> of the
same author be excepted. S. Gessner, J. W. L. Gleim, and G. K.
Pfeffel (1736-1809) composed pastoral plays. But a far more
potent stimulus prompted the efforts of the younger generation.
The translation of Shakespeare, begun in 1762 by C. M. Wieland,
whose own plays possess no special significance, and completed
in 1775 by Eschenburg, which furnished the text for many of
Lessing&rsquo;s criticisms, helps to mark an epoch in German literature.
Under the influence of Shakespeare, or of their conceptions of
his genius, arose a youthful group of writers who, while worshipping
their idol as the representative of nature, displayed but
slight anxiety to harmonize their imitations of him with the
demands of art. The notorious <i>Ugolino</i> of H. W. von Gerstenberg
seemed a premonitory sign that the coming flood might merely
rush back to the extravagances and horrors of the old popular
stage; and it was with a sense of this danger in prospect that
Lessing in his third important drama, the prose tragedy <i>Emilia
Galotti</i> (1772), set the example of a work of incomparable nicety
in its adaptation of means to end. But successful as it proved,
it could not stay the excesses of the <i>Sturm und Drang</i> period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page541" id="page541"></a>541</span>
which now set in. Lessing&rsquo;s last drama, <i>Nathan der Weise</i>
(1779), was not measured to the standard of the contemporary
stage; but it was to exercise its influence in the progress of
time&mdash;not only by causing a reaction in tragedy from prose to
blank verse (first essayed in J. W. von Brawe&rsquo;s <i>Brutus</i>, 1770),
but by ennobling and elevating by its moral and intellectual
grandeur the branch of literature to which in form it
belongs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young geniuses of the <i>Sturm und Drang</i> had
gone forth, as worshippers rather than followers of Shakespeare,
to conquer new worlds. The name of this group of
writers, more remarkable for their collective significance
<span class="sidenote">The Sturm und Drang.</span>
than for their individual achievements, was derived
from a drama by one of the most prolific of their
number, M. F. von Klinger;<a name="fa284a" id="fa284a" href="#ft284a"><span class="sp">284</span></a> other members of the fraternity
were J. A. Leisewitz<a name="fa285a" id="fa285a" href="#ft285a"><span class="sp">285</span></a> (1752-1806), M. R. Lenz<a name="fa286a" id="fa286a" href="#ft286a"><span class="sp">286</span></a> and F. Müller<a name="fa287a" id="fa287a" href="#ft287a"><span class="sp">287</span></a>
the &ldquo;painter.&rdquo; The youthful genius of the greatest of German
poets was itself under the influences of this period, when it
produced the first of its masterpieces. But Goethe&rsquo;s <i>Götz von
Berlichingen</i> (1773), both by the choice and treatment of its
national theme, and by the incomparable freshness and originality
of its style, holds a position of its own in German dramatic
literature. Though its defiant irregularity of form prevented its
complete success upon the stage, yet its influence is far from
being represented by the series of mostly feeble imitations to
which it gave rise. The <i>Ritterdramen</i> (plays of chivalry) had
their day like similar fashions in drama or romance; but the
permanent effect of <i>Götz</i> was, that it crushed as with an iron
hand the last remnants of theatrical conventionality (those of
costume and scenery included), and extinguished with them
the lingering respect for rules and traditions of dramatic composition
which even Lessing had treated with consideration.
Its highest significance, however, lies in its having been the first
great dramatic work of a great national poet, and having
definitively associated the national drama with the poetic glories
of the national literature.</p>

<p>Thus, in the classical period of that literature, of which Goethe
and Schiller were the ruling stars, the drama had a full share
of the loftiest of its achievements. Of these, the
dramatic works of Goethe vary so widely in form and
<span class="sidenote">Goethe.</span>
character, and connect themselves so intimately with the
different phases of the development of his own self-directed
poetic genius, that it was impossible for any of them to become
the starting-points of any general growths in the history of the
German drama. His way of composition was, moreover, so
peculiar to himself&mdash;conception often preceding execution by
many years, part being added to part under the influence of
new sentiments and ideas and views of art, flexibly followed by
changes of form&mdash;that the history of his dramas cannot be
severed from his general poetic and personal biography. His
<i>Clavigo</i> and <i>Stella</i>, which succeeded <i>Götz</i>, are domestic dramas
in prose; but neither by these, nor by the series of charming
pastorals and operas which he composed for the Weimar court,
could any influence be exercised upon the progress of the national
drama. In the first conception of his <i>Faust</i>, he had indeed
sought the suggestion of his theme partly in popular legend,
partly in a domestic motive familiar to the authors of the <i>Sturm
und Drang</i> (the story of Gretchen); the later additions to the
First Part, and the Second Part generally, are the results of
metaphysical and critical studies and meditations belonging
to wholly different spheres of thought and experience. The
dramatic unity of the whole is thus, at the most, external only;
and the standard of judgment to be applied to this wondrous
poem is not one of dramatic criticism. <i>Egmont</i>, originally
designed as a companion to <i>Götz</i>, was not completed till many
years later; there are few dramas more effective in parts, but
the idea of a historic play is lost in the elaboration of the most
graceful of love episodes. In <i>Iphigenia</i> and <i>Tasso</i>, Goethe
exhibited the perfection of form of which his classical period had
enabled him to acquire the mastery; but the sphere of the
action of the former (perfect though it is as a dramatic action),
and the nature of that of the latter, are equally remote from
<span class="sidenote">Schiller.</span>
the demands of the popular stage. Schiller&rsquo;s genius,
unlike Goethe&rsquo;s, was naturally and consistently suited
to the claims of the theatre. His juvenile works, <i>The Robbers</i>,
<i>Fiesco</i>, <i>Kabale und Liebe</i>, vibrating under the influence of an
age of social revolution, combined in their prose form the truthful
expression of passion with a considerable admixture of extravagance.
But, with true insight into the demands of his art,
and with unequalled single-mindedness and self-devotion to it,
Schiller gradually emancipated himself from his earlier style;
and with his earliest tragedy in verse, <i>Don Carlos</i>, the first period
of his dramatic authorship ends, and the promise of the second
announces itself. The works which belong to this&mdash;from the
<i>Wallenstein</i> trilogy to <i>Tell</i>&mdash;are the acknowledged masterpieces
of the German poetic drama, treating historic themes reconstructed
by conscious dramatic workmanship, and clothing their
dialogue in a noble vestment of rhetorical verse. The plays of
Schiller are the living embodiment of the theory of tragedy
elaborated by Hegel, according to which its proper theme is the
divine, or, in other words, the moving ethical, element in human
action. In one of his later plays, <i>The Bride of Messina</i>, Schiller
attempted a new use of the chorus of Greek tragedy; but the
endeavour was a splendid error, and destined to exercise no
lasting effect. The reaction against Schiller&rsquo;s ascendancy began
with writers who could not reconcile themselves with the cosmopolitan
and non-national elements in his genius, and is still
represented by eminent critics; but the future must be left to
settle the contention.</p>

<p>Schiller&rsquo;s later dramas had gradually conquered the stage,
over which his juvenile works had in this time triumphantly
passed, but on which his <i>Don Carlos</i> had met with a
cold welcome. For a long time, however, its favourites
<span class="sidenote">The popular stage.</span>
were authors of a very different order, who suited
themselves to the demands of a public tolerably indifferent
to the literary progress of the drama. After popular
tastes had oscillated between the imitators of <i>Gotz</i> and those of
<i>Emilia Galotti</i>, they entered into a more settled phase, as the
establishment of standing theatres at the courts and in the large
towns increased the demand for good &ldquo;acting&rdquo; plays. Famous
actors, such as Schröder and A. W. Iffland, sought by translations
or compositions of their own to meet the popular likings, which
largely took the direction of that irrepressible favourite of
theatrical audiences, the sentimental domestic drama.<a name="fa288a" id="fa288a" href="#ft288a"><span class="sp">288</span></a> But the
most successful purveyor of such wares was an author who,
though not himself an actor, understood the theatre with a
professional instinct&mdash;August von Kotzebue. His productivity
ranged from the domestic drama and comedy of all kinds to
attempts to rival Schiller and Shakespeare in verse; and though
his popularity (which ultimately proved his doom) brought
upon him the bitterest attacks of the romantic school and other
literary authorities, his self-conceit is not astonishing, and the
time has come for saying that there is some exaggeration in
the contempt which has been lavished upon him by posterity.<a name="fa289a" id="fa289a" href="#ft289a"><span class="sp">289</span></a>
Nor should it be forgotten that German literature had so far
failed to furnish the comic stage with any successors to <i>Minna
von Barnhelm</i>; for Goethe&rsquo;s efforts to dramatize characteristic
events or figures of the Revolutionary age<a name="fa290a" id="fa290a" href="#ft290a"><span class="sp">290</span></a> must be dismissed
as failures, not from a theatrical point of view only. The joint
efforts of Goethe and Schiller for the Weimar stage, important in
many respects for the history of the German drama, at the same
time reveal the want of a national dramatic literature sufficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page542" id="page542"></a>542</span>
to supply the needs of a theatre endeavouring to satisfy the
demands of art.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the so-called romantic school of German literature
was likewise beginning to extend its labours to original dramatic
composition. From the universality of sympathies
proclaimed by this school, to whose leaders Germany
<span class="sidenote">The romantic school.</span>
owed its classical translation of Shakespeare,<a name="fa291a" id="fa291a" href="#ft291a"><span class="sp">291</span></a> and
an introduction to the dramatic literatures of so many
ages and nations,<a name="fa292a" id="fa292a" href="#ft292a"><span class="sp">292</span></a> a variety of new dramatic impulses might be
expected; while much might be hoped for the future of the
national drama (especially in its mixed and comic species) from
the alliance between poetry and real life which they preached,
and which some of them sought personally to exemplify. But in
practice universality presented itself as peculiarity or even as
eccentricity; and in the end the divorce between poetry and
real life was announced as authoritatively as their union had
been. Outside this school, the youthful talent of Th. Körner,
whose early promise as a dramatist<a name="fa293a" id="fa293a" href="#ft293a"><span class="sp">293</span></a> might perhaps have ripened
into a fulness enabling him not unworthily to occupy the seat
left vacant by his father&rsquo;s friend Schiller, was extinguished by a
patriotic death. The efforts of M. von Collin (1779-1824) in the
direction of the historical drama remained isolated attempts.
But of the leaders of the romantic school, A. W.<a name="fa294a" id="fa294a" href="#ft294a"><span class="sp">294</span></a> and F. von
Schlegel<a name="fa295a" id="fa295a" href="#ft295a"><span class="sp">295</span></a> contented themselves with frigid classicalities; and
L. Tieck, in the strange alembic of his <i>Phantasus</i>, melted legend
and fairy-tale, novel and drama,<a name="fa296a" id="fa296a" href="#ft296a"><span class="sp">296</span></a> poetry and satire, into a compound,
enjoyable indeed, but hardly so in its entirety, or in many
of its parts, to any but the literary mind.</p>

<p>F. de La Motte Fouqué infused a spirit of poetry into the
chivalry drama. Klemens Brentano was a fantastic dramatist
unsuited to the stage. Here a feeble outgrowth of the
romanticists, the &ldquo;destiny dramatists&rdquo; Z. Werner<a name="fa297a" id="fa297a" href="#ft297a"><span class="sp">297</span></a>&mdash;the
<span class="sidenote">Later dramatists.</span>
most original of the group&mdash;A. Müllner,<a name="fa298a" id="fa298a" href="#ft298a"><span class="sp">298</span></a> and
Baron C. E. v. Houwald,<a name="fa299a" id="fa299a" href="#ft299a"><span class="sp">299</span></a> achieved a temporary
<i>furore</i>; and it was with an attempt in the same direction<a name="fa300a" id="fa300a" href="#ft300a"><span class="sp">300</span></a>
that the Austrian dramatist F. Grillparzer began his long career.
He is assuredly, what he pronounced himself to be, the foremost
of the later dramatic poets of Germany, unless that tribute be
thought due to the genius of H. von Kleist, who in his short life
produced, besides other works, a romantic drama<a name="fa301a" id="fa301a" href="#ft301a"><span class="sp">301</span></a> and a rustic
comedy<a name="fa302a" id="fa302a" href="#ft302a"><span class="sp">302</span></a> of genuine merit, and an historical tragedy of singular
originality and power.<a name="fa303a" id="fa303a" href="#ft303a"><span class="sp">303</span></a> Grillparzer&rsquo;s long series of plays includes
poetic dramas on classical themes<a name="fa304a" id="fa304a" href="#ft304a"><span class="sp">304</span></a> and historical subjects from
Austrian history,<a name="fa305a" id="fa305a" href="#ft305a"><span class="sp">305</span></a> or treated from an Austrian point of view.
The romantic school, which through Tieck had satirized the
drama of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> and its offshoots, was in its turn satirized
by Count A. von Platen-Hallermund&rsquo;s admirable imitations of
Aristophanic comedy.<a name="fa306a" id="fa306a" href="#ft306a"><span class="sp">306</span></a> Among the objects of his banter were
the popular playwright E. Raupach, and K. Immermann, a
true poet, who is, however, less generally remembered as a
dramatist. F. Hebbel<a name="fa307a" id="fa307a" href="#ft307a"><span class="sp">307</span></a> is justly ranked high among the foremost
later dramatic poets of his country, few of whom equal him in
intensity. The eminent lyrical (especially ballad) poet L. Uhland
left behind him a large number of dramatic fragments, but little
or nothing really complete. Other names of literary mark are
those of C. D. Grabbe, J. Mosen, O. Ludwig<a name="fa308a" id="fa308a" href="#ft308a"><span class="sp">308</span></a> (1813-1865), a
dramatist of great power, and &ldquo;F. Halm&rdquo; (Baron von Münch-Bellinghausen)
(1806-1871), and, among writers of a more
modern school, K. Gutzkow,<a name="fa309a" id="fa309a" href="#ft309a"><span class="sp">309</span></a> G. Freytag,<a name="fa310a" id="fa310a" href="#ft310a"><span class="sp">310</span></a> and H. Laube.<a name="fa311a" id="fa311a" href="#ft311a"><span class="sp">311</span></a>
L. Anzengruber, a writer of real genius though restricted range,
imparted a new significance to the Austrian popular drama,<a name="fa312a" id="fa312a" href="#ft312a"><span class="sp">312</span></a>
formerly so commonplace in the hands of F. Raimund and
J. Nestroy.</p>

<p>During the long period of transition which may be said to have
ended with the establishment of the new German empire, the
German stage in some measure anticipated the developments
which more spacious times were to witness in
<span class="sidenote">The German stage of the latter half of the 19th century.</span>
the German drama. The traditions of the national
theatre contemporary with the great epoch of the
national literature were kept alive by a succession of
eminent actors&mdash;such as the nephews of Ludwig
Devrient, himself an artist of the greatest originality,
whose most conspicuous success, though nature had fitted him for
Shakespeare, was achieved in Schiller&rsquo;s earliest play.<a name="fa313a" id="fa313a" href="#ft313a"><span class="sp">313</span></a> Among
the younger generation of Devrients the most striking personality
was that of Emil; his elder brother Karl August, husband of
Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient, the brilliant star of the operatic
stage, and their son Friedrich, were also popular actors; yet
another brother, Eduard, is more widely remembered as the
historian of the German stage. Partly by reason of the number
and variety of its centres of intellectual and artistic life, Germany
was long enabled both to cherish the few masterpieces of its own
drama, and, with the aid of a language well adapted for translation,
to give admittance to the dramatic masterpieces of other
nations also, and to Shakespeare in particular, without going far
in the search for theatrical novelty or effect. But a change
came over the spirit of German theatrical management with the
endeavours of H. Laube, from about the middle of the century
onwards, at Vienna (and Leipzig), which avowedly placed the
demands of the theatre as such above those of literary merit
or even of national sentiment. In a less combative spirit, F.
Dingelstedt, both at Munich, which under King Maximilian he
had made a kindly nurse of German culture, and, after his
efforts there had come to an untimely end,<a name="fa314a" id="fa314a" href="#ft314a"><span class="sp">314</span></a> at Weimar and at
Vienna, raised the theatre to a very high level of artistic achievement.
The most memorable event in the annals of his managements
was the production on the Weimar stage of the series of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>histories</i>. At a rather later period, of which the
height extended from 1874 to 1890, the company of actors in
the service, and under the personal direction, of Duke George
of Saxe-Meiningen, created a great effect by their performances
both in and outside Germany&mdash;not so much by their artistic
improvements in scenery and decoration, as by the extraordinary
perfection of their <i>ensemble</i>. But no dramaturgic achievement
in the century could compare in grandeur either of conception or
of execution with Richard Wagner&rsquo;s Bayreuth performances,
where, for the first time in the history of the modern stage, the
artistic instinct ruled supreme in all the conditions of the work
and its presentment. Though the <i>Ring of the Nibelungs</i> and its
successors belong to opera rather than drama proper, the importance
of their production (1876) should be overlooked by no
student of the dramatic art. Potent as has been the influence
of foreign dramatic literatures&mdash;whether French or Scandinavian&mdash;and
that of a movement which has been common to them all,
and from which the German was perhaps the least likely to
exclude itself, the most notable feature in the recent history of
the German drama has been its quick response to wholly new
demands, which, though the attempt was made with some
persistence, could no longer be met without an effort to span the
widths and sound the depths of a more spacious and more
self-conscious era.<a name="fa315a" id="fa315a" href="#ft315a"><span class="sp">315</span></a></p>

<p class="center pt2">(h) <i>Dutch Drama.</i></p>

<p>Among other modern European dramas the Dutch is interesting
both in its beginnings, which to all intents and purposes form
part of those of the German, and because of the special influence
of the so-called chambers of the <i>rederykers</i> (rhetoricians), from
the early years of the 15th century onwards, which bear some
resemblance to the associations of the master-singers in contemporary
higher Germany. The earliest of their efforts,
which so effectively tempered the despotism of both church and
state, seem to have been of a dramatic kind; and a manifold
variety of allegories, moralities and comic entertainments
(<i>esbatementen</i> or comedies, <i>kluiten</i> and <i>factien</i> or farces) enhanced
the attractions of those popular pageants in which the Netherlands
surpassed all other countries of the North. The Low
Countries responded more largely to the impulse of the
Renaissance than, with some local exceptions, any other of the
Germanic lands. They necessarily had a considerable share
in the cultivation of the modern Latin drama; and, while the
author of <i>Acolastus</i> may be claimed as its own by the country
of his adoption as well as by that of his birth, G. M. Macropedius
(Langhveldt) (c. 1475-1508), who may be regarded as the foremost
Latin dramatist of his age, was born and died at Hertogenbosch
or in its immediate vicinity. Macropedius, who belonged
to the fraternity of the Common Life, was a writer of great
realistic power as well as of remarkable literary versatility.<a name="fa316a" id="fa316a" href="#ft316a"><span class="sp">316</span></a>
The art of acting flourished in the Low Countries even during
the troubles of the great revolt; but the birth of the regular
drama was delayed till the advent of quieter times. Dutch
dramatic literature begins, under the influence of the classical
studies cherished in the seats of learning founded before and after
the close of the war, with the classical tragedies of S. Koster
(c. 1585-c. 1650). The romantic dramas and farces of Gerbrand
Bredero (1585-1618) and the tragedies of P. Hooft (1581-1647)
belong to the same period; but its foremost dramatic poet was
J. van den Vondel, who from an imitation of classical models
passed to more original forms of dramatic composition, including
a patriotic play and a dramatic treatment of part of what
was to form the theme of <i>Paradise Lost</i>.<a name="fa317a" id="fa317a" href="#ft317a"><span class="sp">317</span></a> But Vondel had no
successor of equal mark. The older form of Dutch tragedy&mdash;in
which the chorus still appeared&mdash;was, especially under the influence
of the critic A. Pels, exchanged for a close imitation of
the French models, Corneille and Racine; nor was the attempt
to create a national comedy successful. Thus no national Dutch
drama was permanently called into life.</p>

<p class="center pt2">(i) <i>Scandinavian Drama.</i></p>

<p>Still more distinctly, the dramatic literature of the Scandinavian
peoples springs from foreign growths. In Denmark,
where the beginnings of the drama in the plays of
the schoolmaster Chr. Hansen recall the mixture of
<span class="sidenote">Denmark.</span>
religious and farcical elements in contemporary German efforts,
the drama in the latter half of the 16th century remained essentially
scholastic, and treated scriptural or classical subjects,
chiefly in the Latin tongue. J. Ranch (1539-1607) and H. S.
Sthen were authors of this type. But often in the course of the
17th century, German and French had become the tongues of
Danish literature and of the Danish theatre; in the 18th Denmark
could boast a comic dramatist of thorough originality
and of a wholly national cast. L. Holberg, one of the most noteworthy
comic poets of modern literature, not only marks an
epoch in the dramatic literature of his native land, but he
contributed to overthrow the trivialities of the German stage
in its worst period, which he satirized with merciless humour,<a name="fa318a" id="fa318a" href="#ft318a"><span class="sp">318</span></a>
and set an example, never surpassed, of a series of comedies<a name="fa319a" id="fa319a" href="#ft319a"><span class="sp">319</span></a>
deriving their types from popular life and ridiculing with healthy
directness those vices and follies which are the proper theme
of the most widely effective species of the comic drama. Among
his followers, P. A. Heiberg is specially noted. Under the
influence of the Romantic school, whose influence has nowhere
proved so long-lived as in the Scandinavian north, A. Ohlenschläger
began a new era of Danish literature. His productivity,
which belongs partly to his native and partly to German literary
history, turned from foreign<a name="fa320a" id="fa320a" href="#ft320a"><span class="sp">320</span></a> to native themes; and other
writers followed him in his endeavours to revive the figures of
<span class="sidenote">The modern Norwegian drama.</span>
Northern heroic legend. But these themes have in their
turn given way in the Scandinavian theatre to subjects
coming nearer home to the popular consciousness,
and treated with a direct appeal to the common
experience of human life, and with a searching insight into the
actual motives of human action. The most remarkable movement
to be noted in the history of the Scandinavian drama,
and one of the most widely effective of those which mark the
more recent history of the Western drama in general, had its
origin in Norway. Two Norwegian dramatists, H. Ibsen and
Björnsterne Björnson, standing as it were side by side, though
by no means always judging eye to eye, have vitally influenced
the whole course of modern dramatic literature in the direction
of a fearlessly candid and close delineation of human nature.
The lesser of the pair in inventive genius, and in the power of
exhibiting with scornful defiance the conflict between soul and
circumstance, but the stronger by virtue of the conviction of
hope which lies at the root of achievement, is Björnson.<a name="fa321a" id="fa321a" href="#ft321a"><span class="sp">321</span></a> Ibsen&rsquo;s
long career as a dramatist exhibits a succession of many changes,
but at no point any failure in the self-trust of his genius. His
early masterpieces were dramatic only in form.<a name="fa322a" id="fa322a" href="#ft322a"><span class="sp">322</span></a> His world-drama
of <i>Emperor and Galilean</i> was still unsuited to a stage
rarely trodden to much purpose by idealists of Julian&rsquo;s type.
The beginnings of his real and revolutionary significance as a
dramatist date from the production of his first plays of contemporary
life, the admirable satirical comedy <i>The Pillars of
Society</i> (1877), the subtle domestic drama <i>A Doll&rsquo;s House</i> (1879),
and the powerful but repellent <i>Ghosts</i> (1881),<a name="fa323a" id="fa323a" href="#ft323a"><span class="sp">323</span></a> which last, with
the effects of its appearance, modern dramatic literature may
even to this day be said to have failed altogether to assimilate.
Ibsen&rsquo;s later prose comedies&mdash;(verse, he writes, has immensely
damaged the art of acting, and a tragedy in iambics belongs to the
species Dodo)&mdash;for the most part written during an exile which
accounts for the note of isolation so audible in many of them,
succeeded one another at regular biennial intervals, growing more
and more abrupt in form, cruel in method, and intense in elemental
dramatic force. The prophet at last spoke to a listening
world, but without the amplitude, the grace and the wholeheartedness
which are necessary for subduing it. But it may be
long before the art which he had chosen as the vehicle of his
comments on human life and society altogether ceases to show
the impress of his genius.</p>

<p class="center pt2">(j) <i>Drama of the Slav Peoples.</i></p>

<p>As to the history of the Slav drama, only a few hints can be
here given. Its origins have not yet&mdash;at least in works accessible
to Western students&mdash;been authoritatively traced. The Russian
drama in its earliest or religious beginnings is stated to have
been introduced from Poland early in the 12th century; and,
again, it would seem that, when the influence of the Renaissance
touched the east of Europe, the religious drama was cultivated
in Poland in the 16th, but did not find its way into Russia
till the 17th century. It is probable that the species was, like so
many other elements of culture, imported into the Carpathian
lands in the 15th or 16th century from Germany. How far
indigenous growths, such as the Russian popular puppet-show
called <i>vertep</i>, which about the middle of the 17th century began
to treat secular and popular themes, helped to foster dramatic
tendencies and tastes, cannot here be estimated. The regular
drama of eastern Europe is to all intents and purposes of Western
origin. Thus, the history of the Polish drama may be fairly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page544" id="page544"></a>544</span>
dated as beginning with the reign of the last king of Poland,
Stanislaus II. Augustus, who in 1765 solemnly opened a national
<span class="sidenote">Polish.</span>
theatre at Warsaw. This institution was carried on
till the fatal year 1794, and saw the production of
a considerable number of Polish plays, mostly translated or
adapted, but in part original&mdash;as in the case of one or two of
those from the active pen of the secretary to the educational
commission, Zablonski. But it was not till after the last partition
that, paradoxically though not wholly out of accordance with
the history of the relations between political and literary
history, the attempts of W. Bogulawski and J. N. Kaminski to
establish and carry on a Polish national theatre were crowned
with success. Its literary mainstay was a gifted Franco-Pole,
Count Alexander Fredro (1793-1876), who in the period between
the Napoleonic revival and the long exodus fathered a long-lived
species of modern Polish comedy, French in origin (for Fredro
was a true disciple of Molière), and wholly out of contact with
the sentiment that survived in the ashes of a doomed nation.<a name="fa324a" id="fa324a" href="#ft324a"><span class="sp">324</span></a>
His complaint as to the exiguity of the Polish literary public&mdash;a
brace of theatres and a bookseller&rsquo;s handcart&mdash;may have been
premature; but a national drama was most certainly impossible
in a denationalised and dismembered land, in whose historic
capital the theatre in which Polish plays continued to be produced
seemed garrisoned by Cossack officers.</p>

<p>Much in the same way, though with a characteristic difference,
the Russian regular drama had its origin in the cadet corps at
St Petersburg, a pupil of which, A. Sumarokov (1718-1777),
has been regarded as the founder of the modern
<span class="sidenote">Russian.</span>
Russian theatre. As a tragic poet he seems to have imitated
Racine and Voltaire, though treating themes from the national
history, among others the famous dramatic subject of the False
Demetrius. He also translated <i>Hamlet</i>. As a comic dramatist
he is stated to have been less popular than as a tragedian; yet
it is in comedy that he would seem to have had the most noteworthy
successors. Among these it is impossible to pass by the
empress Catherine II., whose comedies seem to have been satirical
sketches of the follies and foibles of her subjects, and who in one
comedy as well as in a tragedy had the courage to imitate
Shakespeare. Comedy aiming at social satire long continued
to temper the conditions of Russian society, and had representatives
of mark in such writers as A. N. Ostrovsky of Moscow and
Griboyedov, the author of <i>Gore et uma</i>.</p>

<p>In any survey of the Slav drama that of the Czech peoples,
whose national consciousness has so fully reawakened, must not
be overlooked. A Czech theatre was called into life at Prague
as early as the 18th century; and in the 19th its demands,
centring in a sense of nationality, were met by J. N. Stepinek
(1783-1844), W. C. Klicpera (1792-1859) and J. C. Tyl (1808-1856);
and later writers continued to make use of the stage for
a propaganda of historical as well as political significance.</p>

della Scala only a chorus remains. He died after 1389. Probably
to the earlier half of the century belongs the Latin prose drama
<i>Columpnarium</i>, the story of which, though it ends happily, resembles
that of <i>The Cenci</i>. Later plays in Latin of the historic type are the
extant Landivio de&rsquo; Nobili&rsquo;s <i>De captivitate Ducis Jacobi</i> (the <i>condottiere</i>
Jacopo Piccinino, d. 1464); C. Verardi&rsquo;s <i>Historia Baetica</i>
(the expulsion of the Moors from Granada) (1492), and the game
author&rsquo;s <i>Ferdinandus</i> (of Aragon) <i>Servatus</i>, which is called a tragi-comedy
because it is neither tragic nor comic. The Florentine
L. Dali&rsquo;s <i>Hiempsal</i> (1441-1442) remains in MS. A few tragedies on
sacred subjects were produced in Italy during the last quarter of the
15th century, and a little later. Such were the religious dramas
written for his pupils by P. Domizio, on which Politian cast contempt;
and the tragedies, following ancient models, of T. da Prato of Treviso,
B. Campagna of Verona, <i>De passione Redemptoris</i>; and G. F. Conti,

soldier and man of fashion who was possessed of great intellectual

critical works included <i>Remarks on English Comedy</i> (1677), and one

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRAMMEN,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> a seaport of Norway, in Buskerud and Jarlsberg-Laurvik
<i>amter</i> (counties), at the head of Drammen Fjord, a
western arm of Christiania Fjord, 33 m. by rail S. W. from
Christiania. Pop. (1900) 23,093. Its situation, at the mouth
of the broad Drammen river, between lofty hills, is very beautiful.
It is the junction of railways from Christiania to Haugsund,
Kongsberg and Hönefos, and to Laurvik and Skien. The town
is modern, having suffered from fires in 1866, 1870 and 1880.
It consists of three parts: Bragernaes on the north, divided by
the river from Strömsö and the port, Tangen, on the south.
The prosperity of Drammen depends mainly on the timber
trade; and saw-milling is an active industry, the logs being
floated down the river from the upland forests. Timber and
wood-pulp are exported (over half of each to Great Britain),
with paper, ice and some cobalt and nickel ore. The chief
imports are British coal and German machinery. Salmon are
taken in the upper reaches of the Drammen.</p>

was born at Bromley, near Bow, on the 29th of December 1823.
Brought up in the Anglican creed, she fell under the influence of
Tractarian teaching at Torquay, and joined the Roman Catholic
Church in 1850. She wrote, and published anonymously, an
essay questioning the <i>Morality of Tractarianism</i>, which was
attributed to John Henry Newman. In 1852, after a prolonged
stay in Rome, she joined the third order of St Dominic, to which
she belonged for over forty years. She was prioress (1872-1881)
of the Stone convent in Staffordshire, where she died on the 29th
of April 1894. Her chief works in prose and verse are: <i>The
History of Saint Dominic</i> (1857; enlarged edition, 1891); <i>The
Life of St Catherine of Siena</i> (1880; 2nd ed., 1899); <i>Christian
Schools and Scholars</i> (1867); <i>The Knights of St John</i> (1858);
<i>Songs in the Night</i> (1876); and the <i>Three Chancellors</i> (1859), a

<p><span class="bold">DRAPER, JOHN WILLIAM<a name="ar5" id="ar5"></a></span> (1811-1882), American scientist,
was born at St Helen&rsquo;s, near Liverpool, on the 5th of May 1811.
He studied at Woodhouse Grove, at the University of London,
and, after removing to America in 1832, at the medical school of
the University of Pennsylvania in 1835-1836. In 1837 he was
elected professor of chemistry in the University of the City of
New York, and was a professor in its school of medicine in 1840-1850,
president of that school in 1850-1873, and professor of
chemistry until 1881. He died at Hastings, New York, on the
4th of January 1882. He made important researches in photo-chemistry,
made portrait photography possible by his improvements
(1839) on Daguerre&rsquo;s process, and published a <i>Text-book on
Chemistry</i> (1846), <i>Text-book on Natural Philosophy</i> (1847), <i>Text-book
on Physiology</i> (1866), and <i>Scientific Memoirs</i> (1878) on
radiant energy. He is well known also as the author of <i>The
History of the Intellectual Development of Europe</i> (1862), applying
the methods of physical science to history, a <i>History of the
American Civil War</i> (3 vols., 1867-1870), and a <i>History of the
Conflict between Religion and Science</i> (1874).</p>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Henry Draper</span> (1837-1882), graduated at the
University of New York in 1858, became professor of natural
science there in 1860, and was professor of physiology (in the
medical school) and dean of the faculty in 1866-1873. He
succeeded his father as professor of chemistry, but only for a
year, dying in New York on the 20th of November 1882. Henry
Draper&rsquo;s most important contributions to science were made in
spectroscopy; he ruled metal gratings in 1869-1870, made
valuable spectrum photographs after 1871, and proved the
presence of oxygen in the sun in a monograph of 1877. Edward
C. Pickering carried on his study of stellar spectra with the funds
of the Henry Draper Memorial at Harvard, endowed by his
widow (<i>née</i> Mary Anna Palmer).</p>

Fr. <i>drap</i>, cloth, from which <i>drapier</i> and Eng. &ldquo;draper&rdquo; are
derived, is of obscure origin. It is possible that the Low Lat.
<i>drappus</i> or <i>trappus</i> (the last form giving the Eng. &ldquo;trappings&rdquo;)
may be connected with words such as &ldquo;drub,&rdquo; Ger. <i>treffen</i>,
beat; the original sense would be fulled cloth. &ldquo;Drab,&rdquo; dull,
pale, brown, is also connected, its first meaning being a cloth of
a natural undyed colour. The Drapers&rsquo; Company is one of the
great livery companies of the city of London. The fraternity
is of very early origin. Henry Fitz-Alwyn (d. 1212?), the first
mayor of London, is said to have been a draper. The first
charter was granted in 1364. The Drapers&rsquo; Gild was one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page547" id="page547"></a>547</span>
numerous subdivisions of the clothing trade, and appeared to
have been confined to the retailing of woollen cloths, the linen-drapers
forming in the 15th century a separate fraternity,
which disappeared or was merged in the greater company. It
is usual for drapers to combine the sale of &ldquo;drapery,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> of
textiles generally, with that of millinery, hosiery, &amp;c. In <i>Wills</i>
v. <i>Adams</i> (reported in <i>The Times</i>, London, Nov. 20, 1908), the
term &ldquo;drapery&rdquo; in a restrictive covenant was held not to include
all goods that a draper might sell, such as furs or fur-lined goods.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRAUGHT<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> (from the common Teutonic word &ldquo;to draw&rdquo;;
cf. Ger. <i>Tracht</i>, load; the pronunciation led to the variant form
&ldquo;draft,&rdquo; now confined to certain specific meanings), the act or
action of drawing, extending, pulling, &amp;c. It is thus applied
to animals used for drawing vehicles or loads, &ldquo;draught oxen,&rdquo;
&amp;c., to the quantity of fish taken by one &ldquo;drag&rdquo; of a net, to
a quantity of liquid taken or &ldquo;drawn in&rdquo; to the mouth, and to
a current of air in a chimney, a room or other confined space.
In furnaces the &ldquo;draught&rdquo; is &ldquo;natural&rdquo; when not increased
artificially, or &ldquo;forced&rdquo; when increased by mechanical methods
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Boiler</a></span>). The water a ship &ldquo;draws,&rdquo; or her &ldquo;draught,&rdquo;
is the depth to which she sinks in the water as measured from
her keel. The word was formerly used of a &ldquo;move&rdquo; in chess or
similar games, and is thus, in the plural, the general English
name of the game known also as &ldquo;checkers&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Draughts</a></span>).
The spelling &ldquo;draft&rdquo; is generally employed in the following
usages. It is a common term for a written order &ldquo;drawn on&rdquo;
a banker or other holder of funds for the payment of money to a
third person; thus a cheque (<i>q.v.</i>) is a draft. A special form of
draft is a &ldquo;banker&rsquo;s draft,&rdquo; an instruction by one bank to another
bank, or to a branch of the bank making the instruction, to pay
a sum of money to the order of a certain specified person. Other
meanings of &ldquo;draft&rdquo; are an outline, plan or sketch, or a preliminary
drawing up of an instrument, measure, document, &amp;c.,
which, after alteration and amendment, will be embodied in a
final or formal shape; an allowance made by merchants or
importers to those who sell by retail, to make up a loss incurred
in weighing or measuring; and a detachment or body of troops
&ldquo;drawn off&rdquo; for a specific purpose, usually a reinforcement
from the depot or reserve units to those abroad or in the field.

architecture see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Drafted Masonry</a></span>.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRAUGHTS<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> (from A.S. <i>dragan</i>, to draw), a game played with
pieces (or &ldquo;men&rdquo;) called draughtsmen on a board marked in
squares of two alternate colours. The game is called Checkers
in America, and is known to the French as <i>Les Dames</i> and to the
Germans as <i>Damenspiel</i>. Though the game is not mentioned in
the <i>Complete Gamester</i>, nor the <i>Académie de jeux</i>, and is styled a
&ldquo;modern invention&rdquo; by Strutt, yet a somewhat similar game
was known to the Egyptians, some of the pieces used having
been found in tombs at least as old as 1600 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>, and part of
Anect Hat-Shepsa&rsquo;s board and some of her men are to be
seen in the Egyptian gallery of the British Museum. An
Egyptian vase also shows a lion and an antelope playing at
draughts, with five men each, the lion making the winning move
and seizing the bag or purse that contains the stakes. Plato
ascribes the invention of the game of <span class="grk" title="pessoi">&#960;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#959;&#943;</span>, or draughts, to
Thoth, the Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus, and Homer represents
Penelope&rsquo;s suitors as playing it (<i>Odyss.</i> i. 107). In one form of
the game as played by the Greeks there were 25 squares, and each
player had 5 men which were probably moved along the lines.
In another there were 4 men and 16 squares with a &ldquo;sacred
enclosure,&rdquo; a square of the same size as the others, marked in
the exact centre and bisected by one of the horizontal lines,
which was known as the &ldquo;sacred line.&rdquo; From the incident in
the game of a piece hemmed in on this line by a rival piece
having to be pushed forward as a last resort, arose the phrase
&ldquo;to move the man from the sacred line&rdquo; as synonymous with
being hard pressed. This and other phrases based on incidents
in the game testify to the vogue the game enjoyed in ancient
Greece. The Roman game of <i>Latrunculi</i> was similar, but there
were officers (kings in modern draughts) as well as men. When
a player&rsquo;s pieces were all hemmed in he was stale-mated, to
use a chess phrase (<i>ad incitas redactus est</i>), and lost the game.
Other explanations of this phrase are, however, given (see <i>Les
Jeux des anciens</i>, by Becq de Fouquières). The fullest account
of the Roman game is to be found in the <i>De laude Pisonis</i>,
written by an anonymous contemporary of Nero (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Calpurnius,
Titus</a></span>). Unfortunately the texts are full of obscurities, so that
it is difficult to make any definite statements as to how the
game was played.</p>

<p>As early as the 11th century some form of the game was
practised by the Norsemen, for in the Icelandic saga of Grettir
the Strong the board and men are mentioned more than once.</p>

<p>The history of the modern forms of the game starts with
<i>El Ingenio o juego de marro, de punto o damas</i>, published by
Torquemada at Valencia in 1547. Another Spaniard, Juan
Garcia Canalejas, is said to have published in 1610 the first
edition of his work, a better-known edition of which appeared
in 1650. The third Spanish classic, that of Joseph Carlos Garcez,
was printed in Madrid in 1684. It is noteworthy that in an
illustration in Garcez&rsquo;s book the pieces depicted resemble somewhat
some of those used by the Egyptians, and are not unlike
the pawns used in chess.</p>

<p>In 1668 Pierre Mallet had published the first French work on
the game, and elementary though his knowledge of the game
seems to have been, even in comparison with that of Canalejas
or Garcez, the historical notes, rules and instructions which he
gave, served as a basis for many later works. Mallet wrote on
<i>Le Jeu de dames à la française</i>, which was almost identical with
the modern English game. The old French game is, however,
no longer practised in France, having been superseded by <i>Le
Jeu de dames à la polonaise</i>. Manoury gives reasons for believing
that the latter game originated in Paris about 1727.</p>

<p>About 1736 a famous player named Laclef published the first
book on Polish draughts, but the first important book on the
game is Manoury&rsquo;s <i>Jeu de dames à la polonaise</i>, in the production
of which it is said that the author had the assistance of Diderot
and other <i>encyclopédistes</i>. This book, which appeared in 1787,
was to the new game all that Mallet&rsquo;s was to the old French game,
and until the appearance of Poirson Prugneaux&rsquo;s <i>Encyclopédie
du jeu de dames</i> in 1855 it remained the standard authority on
so-called Polish draughts. The Polish game early attained
popularity in Holland, and in 1785 the standard Dutch work,
Ephraim van Embden&rsquo;s <i>Verhandeling over het Damspel</i>, was
produced. In German-speaking countries the progress of the
new game was slower, and the works produced in the first half
of the 19th century generally treat of the older game as well as
the Polish game. This is also the case with Petroff&rsquo;s book
published in St Petersburg in 1827; and similarly Zongono&rsquo;s,
which dates from 1832, deals with the new game and with the
older Italian game.</p>

<p>In 1694 Hyde wrote <i>Historia dami ludi seu latrinculorum</i>,
in which he tried to prove the identity of draughts with <i>ludus
latrinculorum</i>. This work is historical and descriptive, but contains
nothing concerning the game as played in Great Britain.
The authentic history of draughts in England commences with
William Payne&rsquo;s <i>Introduction to the Game of Draughts</i>, the
dedication of which was written by Samuel Johnson. Payne&rsquo;s
games and problems were incorporated in a much more important
work, namely Sturges&rsquo;s <i>Guide to the Game of Draughts</i>, which
appeared in 1800 and has gone through a score of editions.
About this time the game was much practised in both England
and Scotland, but the first important production of the Scottish
school was Drummond&rsquo;s <i>Scottish Draught Player</i>, the first part
of which dates from 1838, additional volumes appearing in 1851-1853
and 1861. In 1852 Andrew Anderson published his <i>Game
of Draughts Simplified</i>. A first edition had appeared in 1848,
but the later print is the important one, as it standardized the
laws of the game, fixed the nomenclature of the openings,
introduced a better arrangement of the play, and, since Anderson
was one of the finest players of the game, excelled in accuracy.
In Anderson&rsquo;s time little was known about the openings commencing
with any move other than 11-15, and it was not until
more than thirty years later that the other openings received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page548" id="page548"></a>548</span>
more adequate recognition. This was done in Robertson&rsquo;s
<i>Guide to the Game of Draughts</i>, and perhaps better in Lees&rsquo; <i>Guide</i>
(1892).</p>

<p>Andrew Anderson was the first recognized British champion
player of the game. He and Wyllie, better known as &ldquo;the herd
laddie,&rdquo; contested five matches for the honour, Anderson winning
four to Wyllie&rsquo;s one. After his victory in 1847 Anderson
retired from match play and the title fell to Wyllie, who made
the game his profession and travelled all over the English-speaking
world to play it. In 1872 he successfully defended his
position against Martins, the English champion, and in 1874
against W. R. Barker, the American champion, but two years
later he was beaten by Yates, a young American. On the latter&rsquo;s
retirement from the game, the championship lapsed to Wyllie,
who held it successfully until his defeat by Ferrie, the Scottish
champion, in 1894. Two years later Ferrie was beaten in his
turn by Richard Jordan of Edinburgh, who had just gained the
Scottish championship; and the new holder defeated Stewart,
who challenged him in 1897, and successfully defended his title
against C. F. Barker, the American champion, to meet whom he
visited Boston in 1900 and played a drawn match.</p>

<p>In 1884 the first international match between England and
Scotland took place, and resulted in so decisive a victory for the
northerners that the contest was not renewed for ten years.
The matches played in 1894 and 1899 also went strongly in
favour of the Scots, but in 1903 the Englishmen gained their
first victory.</p>

<p>In 1905 a British team visited America and defeated a side
representing the United States.</p>

<p>The tournament for the Scottish championship has been held
annually in Glasgow since 1893. The number and skill of the
Scottish players have given this tournament its pre-eminence;
but if the levelling up of the standards of play in Scotland and
England continues, the competition which is held biennially by
the English Draughts Association is likely to rank as a serious
rival to the Glasgow tourney.</p>

<p><i>The English Game.</i>&mdash;Draughts as played now in English-speaking
countries is a game for two persons with a board and
twenty-four men&mdash;twelve white and twelve black&mdash;which at
starting are placed as follows: the black men on the squares
numbered 1 to 12, and the white men on the squares numbered
21 to 32 on the diagram below. In printed diagrams the men are
usually shown on the white squares for the sake of clearness,
but in actual play the black squares
are generally used now. In playing
on the black squares the board must
be placed with a black square in the
left-hand corner. The game is played
by moving a man forward, one square
at a time except when making a capture,
along the diagonals to the right
or left. Thus a white man placed
on square 18 in the diagram can
move to 15 or 14. Each player
moves alternately, black always
moving first. If a player touch a
piece he must move that piece and no other. If the piece
cannot be moved, or if it is not the player&rsquo;s turn to
move, he forfeits the game. As soon as a man reaches
one of the squares farthest from his side of the board, he is
&ldquo;crowned&rdquo; by having one of the unused or captured men of
his own colour placed on him, and becomes a &ldquo;king.&rdquo; A
king has the power of moving and taking backwards as well as
forwards.</p>

<p>If a man is on the square adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s man,
and there is an unoccupied square beyond, the unprotected
man must be captured and removed from the board. Thus, if
there is a white man on square 18, and a black man on square
14, square 9 being vacant, and white having to move, he
jumps over 14 and remains on square 9, and the man on 14
is taken up.</p>

<p>If two or more men are so placed that one square intervenes
between each they may all be taken at one move. Thus if
white having to move has a man on 28, and black men on 24,
16 and 8, the intermediate squares and square 3 being vacant,
white could move from 28 to 3, touching 19 and 12 en route,
and take the men on 24, 16, and 8; but if there is a piece on 7
and square 10 is vacant, the piece on 7 cannot be captured,
for becoming a king ends the move.</p>

<p>It is compulsory to take if possible. If a player can take a
man (or a series of men) but makes a move that does not capture
(or does not capture all that is possible), his adversary may allow
the move to stand, or he may have the move retracted and compel
the player to take, or he may allow the move to stand and remove
the piece, that neglected to capture from the board (called
&ldquo;huffing&rdquo;). &ldquo;Huff and move&rdquo; go together, <i>i.e.</i> the player
who huffs then makes his move. When one player has lost all
his pieces, or has all those left on the board blocked, he loses
the game.</p>

<p>The game is drawn when neither of the players has sufficient
advantage in force or position to enable him to win.</p>

<p>The losing game, or &ldquo;first off the board,&rdquo; is a form of draughts
not much practised now by expert draught players. The player
wins who gets all his pieces taken first. There is no &ldquo;huffing&rdquo;;
a player who can take must do so.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Draughts Openings.</i>&mdash;As there are seven possible first moves, with
seven possible replies to each, or forty-nine in all, there is an abundant
variety of openings; but as two of these (9-14, 21-17 and 10-14, 21-17)
are obviously unsound, the number is really reduced to forty-seven.
Much difference of opinion exists regarding the relative strength of
the various openings. It was at one time generally held that for the
black side 11-15 was the best opening move.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the 19th century this view became much
modified, and though 11-15 still remained the favourite, it was
recognized that 10-15, 9-14 and 11-16 were little, if at all, inferior;
10-14 and 12-16 were rightly rated as weaker than the four moves
named above, whilst 9-13, the favourite of the &ldquo;unscientific&rdquo;
player, was found to be weakest of all.</p>

<p>The white replies to 11-15 have gone through many vicissitudes.
The seven possible moves have each at different times figured as the
general favourite. Thus 24-19, which analysis proved to be the
weakest of the seven, was at one period described by the title of
&ldquo;Wyllie&rsquo;s Invincible.&rdquo; In course of time it came to be regarded as
decidedly weak, and its name was altered to the less pretentious
title of &ldquo;Second Double Corner.&rdquo; In the Scottish Tournament of
1894 this opening was played between Ferrie and Stewart, and the
latter won the game with white, introducing new play which has
stood the test of analysis, and so rehabilitating the opening in public
favour. The 21-17 reply to 11-15 was introduced by Wyllie, who
was so successful with it that it became known as the &ldquo;Switcher.&rdquo;
This opening perhaps lacks the solid strength of some of the others,
but it so abounds in traps as to be well worthy of its name. The other
five replies to 11-15, namely 24-20, 23-19, 23-18, 22-18 and 22-17,
are productive of games which give equal chances to both sides.</p>

<p>The favourite replies to 10-15 are 23-18, 22-18 and 21-17, but
they do not appear to be appreciably stronger than the others, with
the possible exception of 24-20.</p>

<p>In response to 11-16, 23-18 is held to give white a trifling advantage,
but it is more apparent than real. With the exception of 23-19,
which is weak, the other replies are of equal strength, and are only
slightly, if at all, inferior to the more popular 23-18. 9-14 is most
frequently encountered by 22-18, but all white&rsquo;s replies are good,
except of course 21-17 which loses a man, and 23-18 which weakens
the centre of white&rsquo;s position.</p>

<p>Against 10-14 the most popular move is 22-17, which gives white
an advantage. Next in strength come 22-18 and 24-19. 23-18 is
weak.</p>

<p>The strongest reply to 12-16 is 24-20. The others, except 23-19,
which is weak, give no initial advantage to either side.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, 9-13 is black&rsquo;s weakest opening move,
both 22-18 and 24-19 giving white a distinct advantage. Nevertheless
9-13 is a favourite début with certain expert players, especially
when playing with inferior opponents.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;opening&rdquo; is frequently applied in a more restricted
sense than that used above. When practically all games started with
11-15 it was convenient to assign names to the more popular lines
of play. Thus 11-15, 23-19, 8-11, 22-17, if followed by 11-16, was
called the &ldquo;Glasgow&rdquo;; if followed by 9-13, 17-14, the &ldquo;Laird
and Lady&rdquo;; if by 3-8, the &ldquo;Alma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The variety possible in the opening is a fair reply to the objection
sometimes heard that the game does not afford sufficient scope for
variation. As a matter of fact a practically unlimited number of
different games might be played on any one opening.</p>

<p>The three following games are typical examples of the play arising
from three of the most frequently played openings:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Other Varieties.</i>&mdash;The forms of draughts practised on the European
continent differ in some respects from the English variety, chiefly
in respect of the power assigned to a man after &ldquo;crowning.&rdquo; The
game of <i>Polish Draughts</i> is played in France, Holland, Belgium and
Poland, where it has entirely superseded <i>Le Jeu de dames à la
française</i>. It is played on a board of 100 squares with 20 men a side.
The men move and capture as in English draughts, except that in
capturing they move either forward or backward. A crowned man
becomes a queen, and can move any number of squares along the
diagonal. In her capture she takes any unguarded man or queen
in any diagonal she commands, leaping over the captured man or
queen and remaining on any unoccupied square she chooses of the
same diagonal, beyond the piece taken. But if there is another unguarded
man she is bound to choose the diagonal on which it can be
taken. For example (using an English draught-board) place a
queen on square 29 and adverse men at squares 22, 16, 24, 14. The
queen is bound to move from 29 to 11, 20, 27, and having made the
captures to remain at 9 or 5, whichever she prefers. The capturing
queen or man must take all the adverse pieces that are <i>en prise</i>, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page550" id="page550"></a>550</span>
that become so by the uncovering of any square from which a piece
has been removed during the capture, <i>e.g.</i> white queen at square 7,
black at squares 10, 18, 19, 22 and 27, the queen captures at 10,
22, 27 and 19, and the piece at 22 being now removed, she must go
to 15, take the man at 18, and stay at 22, 25 or 29. In consequence
of the intricacy of some of these moves, it is customary to remove
every captured piece as it is taken. If a man arrives at a crowning
square when taking, and he can still continue to take, he must do so,
and not stay on the crowning square as at draughts. Passing a
crowning square in taking does not entitle him to be made a queen.
In capturing, the player must choose the direction by which he can
take the greatest number of men or queens, or he may be huffed.
Numerical power is the criterion, <i>e.g.</i> three men must be taken in
preference to two queens. If the numbers are equal and one force
comprises more queens than the other, the player may take whichever
lot he chooses. This form of draughts, played on a board of 144
squares with 30 men a side, is extensively practised by British
soldiers in India.</p>

<p>The German <i>Damenspiel</i> is Polish draughts played on a board of
the same size and with the same number of men as in the English
game. It is sometimes called Minor Polish draughts, and is practised
in Germany and Russia.</p>

<p>The <i>Italian game</i> differs from the English in two important
particulars&mdash;a man may not take a king, and when a player has the
option of capturing pieces in more than one way he must take in the
manner which captures most pieces. There is a difference too in the
placing of the board, the black square in the corner of the board
being at the player&rsquo;s right hand, but until a king is obtained the
differences from the English system are unimportant in practice.</p>

<p>In <i>Spanish draughts</i> the board is set as for the Italian game. The
men move as in English draughts, but, in capturing, the largest
possible number of pieces must be taken, and the king has the same
powers as in the Polish game. The game does not differ essentially
from the English game until a king is obtained, and many games from
Spanish works will be found incorporated in English books. Sometimes
the game is played with 11 men and a king, or 10 men and
2 kings a side, instead of the regulation 12 men.</p>

<p><i>Turkish draughts</i> differs widely from all other modern varieties
of the game. It is played on a board of 64 squares, all of which are
used in play. Each player has 16 pieces, which are not placed on
the two back rows of squares, as in chess, but on the second and third
back rows. The pieces do not move diagonally as in other forms
of the game, but straight forward or to the right or left horizontally.
The king has the same command of a horizontal or vertical row of
squares that the queen in Polish draughts has over a diagonal.
Capturing is compulsory, and the greatest possible number of pieces
must be taken, captured pieces being removed one at a time as taken.</p>

through Austria and Hungary. It rises below the Innichner Eck,
near the Toblacher Feld in Tirol, at an altitude of a little over
4000 ft., runs eastward, and forms the longest longitudinal
valley of the Alps. The Drave has a total length of 450 m.,
while the length of its Alpine valley to Marburg is 150 m., and to
its junction with the Mur 250 m. Owing to its great extent and
easy accessibility the valley of the Drave was the principal road
through which the invading peoples of the East, as the Huns,
the Slavs and the Turks, penetrated the Alpine countries. The
Drave flows through Carinthia and Styria, and enters Hungary
near Friedau, where up to its confluence with the Danube, at
Almas, 14 m. E. of Esseg, it forms the boundary between that
country and Croatia-Slavonia. At its mouth the Drave attains
a breadth of 1055 ft. and a depth of 20 ft. The Drave is navigable
for rafts only from Villach, and for steamers from Bárcs,
a distance of 95 m. The principal affluents of the Drave are:
on the left the Isel, the Gurk, the Lavant, and the largest of all,
the Mur; and on the right the Gail and the Drann.</p>

<p>Of these Tamil and Malay&#257;lam can be considered as two
dialects of one and the same language, which is, in its turn,
closely related to Kanarese. Tulu, Kodagu, Toda and K&#333;ta
can be described as lying between Tamil-Malay&#257;lam and
Kanarese, though they are more nearly related to the latter
than to the former. The same is the case with Kuru&chi; and Malto,
while Kui and G&#333;nd&#299; gradually approach Telugu, which latter
language seems to have branched off from the common stock
at an early date. Finally, the Br&#257;h&#363;&#299; dialect of Baluchistan has
been so much influenced by other languages that it is no longer
a pure Dravidian form of speech.</p>

<p>The Dravidian languages have for ages been restricted to the
territory they occupy at the present day. Moreover, they are
gradually losing ground in the north, where they meet with
Aryan forms of speech. If we compare the caste tables and the
language tables in the Indian census of 1901 we find that only
1,125,479 out of the 2,286,913 G&#333;nds returned were stated to
speak the Dravidian G&#333;nd&#299;. Similarly only 1505 out of 17,187
K&#333;l&#257;ms entered their language as K&#333;l&#257;m&#299;. Such tribes are
gradually becoming Hinduized. Their language adopts an ever-increasing
Aryan element till it is quite superseded by Aryan
speech. In the north-eastern part of the Dravidian territory,
to the east of Chanda and Bhandara, the usual state of affairs
is that Dravidian dialects are spoken in the hills while Aryan
forms of speech prevail in the plains. The Dravidian Kui thus
stands out as an isolated island in the sea of Aryan speech.</p>

<p>This process has been going on from time immemorial. The
Dravidians were already settled in India when the Aryans
arrived from the north-west. The fair Aryans were at once struck
by their dark hue, and named them accordingly <i>k&#7771;i&#7779;&#7751;a tvac</i>,
the black skin. In the course of time, however, the two races
began to mix, and it is still possible to trace a Dravidian element
in the Aryan languages of North India.</p>

<p>The teaching of anthropology is to the same effect. Most
speakers of Dravidian languages belong to a distinct anthropological
type which is known as the Dravidian. &ldquo;The Dravidian
race,&rdquo; says Sir H. Risley, &ldquo;the most primitive of the Indian
types, occupies the oldest geological formation in India, the
medley of forest-clad ranges, terraced plateaus, and undulating
plains which stretches, roughly speaking, from the Vindhyas
to Cape Comorin. On the east and west of the peninsular area
the domain of the Dravidian is conterminous with the Ghats,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page551" id="page551"></a>551</span>
while farther north it reaches on one side to the Aravallis and
on the other to the Rajmahal hills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This territory is the proper home of the race. A strong
Dravidian element can, however, also be traced in the population
of northern India. In Kashmir and Punjab, where the Aryans
had already settled in those prehistoric times when the Vedic
hymns were composed, the prevailing type is the Aryan one. The
same is the case in Rajputana. From the eastern frontier of the
Punjab, on the other hand, and eastwards, a Dravidian element
can be traced. This is the case in the valleys of the Ganges
and the Jumna, where the Aryans only settled at a later period.
Anthropologists also state that there is a Dravidian element in
the population of western India, from Gujarat to Coorg.</p>

<p>It is thus probable that Dravidian languages have once been
spoken in many tracts which are now occupied by Aryan forms
of speech. The existence of a Dravidian dialect in Baluchistan
seems to show that Dravidian settlers have once lived in those
parts. The tribe in question, the Br&#257;h&#363;&#299;s, are, however, now
Eranians and not Dravidians by race, and it is not probable
that there has ever been a numerous Dravidian population in
Baluchistan. The Br&#257;h&#363;&#299;s are most likely the descendants of
settlers from the south.</p>

<p>There is no indication that the Dravidians have entered India
from outside or superseded an older population. For all practical
purposes they can accordingly be considered as the aborigines
of the Deccan, whence they appear to have spread over part of
northern India. Their languages <span class="correction" title="amended from 'from'">form</span> an isolated group, and
it has not been possible to prove a connexion with any other
family of languages. Such attempts have been made with
reference to the Munda family, the Tibeto-Burman languages,
and the dialects spoken by the aborigines of the Australian
continent. The arguments adduced have not, however, proved
to be sufficient, and only the Australian hypothesis can still
lay claim to some probability. Till it has been more closely
tested we must therefore consider the Dravidian family as an
isolated group of languages, with several characteristic features
of its own.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The pronunciation is described as soft and mellifluous. Abruptness
and hard combinations of sounds are avoided. There is, for
example, a distinct tendency to avoid pronouncing a short consonant
at the end of a word, a very short vowel being often added after it.
Thus the pronoun of the third person singular, which is <i>avan</i>, &ldquo;he,&rdquo;
in Tamil, is pronounced <i>avanu</i> in Kanarese; the Sanskrit word
<i>v&#257;k</i>, &ldquo;speech,&rdquo; is borrowed in the form <i>v&#257;ku</i> in Tamil; the word
<i>gurram</i>, &ldquo;horse,&rdquo; is commonly pronounced <i>gurramu</i> in Telugu, and
so on. Combinations of consonants are further avoided in many
cases where speakers of other languages do not experience any
difficulty in pronouncing them. This tendency is well illustrated
by the changes undergone by some borrowed words. Thus the
Sanskrit word <i>br&#257;hma&#7751;a</i>, &ldquo;a Brahmin,&rdquo; becomes <i>bar&#257;ma&#7751;a</i> in
Kanarese and <i>pir&#257;ma&#7751;a</i> in Tamil; the Sanskrit <i>Drami&#7693;a</i>, &ldquo;Dravidian,&rdquo;
is borrowed by Tamil under the form <i>Tir&#257;mi&#7693;a</i>. <i>Drami&#7693;a</i>,
which also occurs as <i>Dravi&#7693;a</i>, is in its turn developed from an older
<i>Dami&#7735;a</i>, which is identical with the word <i>Tami&#7771;</i>, Tamil.</p>

<p>The forms <i>pir&#257;ma&#7751;a</i> and <i>Tir&#257;mi&#7693;a</i> in Tamil illustrate another
feature of Dravidian enunciation. There is a tendency in all of
them, and in Tamil and Malay&#257;lam it has become a law, against
any word being permitted to begin with a stopped voiced consonant
(<i>g</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>&#7693;</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>b</i>), the corresponding voiceless sounds (<i>k</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>&#7789;</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>p</i>, respectively)
being substituted. In the middle of a word or compound,
on the other hand, every consonant must be voiced. Thus the
Sanskrit word <i>danta</i>, &ldquo;tooth,&rdquo; has been borrowed by Tamil in the
form <i>tandam</i>, and the Telugu <i>anna</i>, &ldquo;elder brother,&rdquo; <i>tammulu</i>,
&ldquo;younger brother,&rdquo; become when compounded <i>annadammulu</i>,
&ldquo;elder and younger brothers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is no strongly marked accent on any one syllable, though
there is a slight stress upon the first one. In some dialects this
equilibrium between the different parts of a word is accompanied
by a tendency to approach to each other the sound of vowels in
consecutive syllables. This tendency, which has been called the
&ldquo;law of harmonic sequence,&rdquo; is most apparent in Telugu, where
the short <i>u</i> of certain suffixes is replaced by <i>i</i> when the preceding
syllable contains one of the vowels <i>i</i> (short and long) and <i>ei</i>. Compare
the dative suffix <i>ku</i>, <i>ki</i>, in <i>gurramu-ku</i>, &ldquo;to a horse&rdquo;; but
<i>tammuni-ki</i>, &ldquo;to a younger brother.&rdquo; This tendency does not,
however, play a prominent rôle in the Dravidian languages.</p>

<p>Words are formed from roots and bases by means of suffixed
formative additions. The root itself generally remains unchanged
throughout. Thus from the Tamil base <i>per</i>, &ldquo;great,&rdquo; we can form
adjectives such as <i>per-iya</i> and <i>per-um</i>, &ldquo;great&rdquo;; verbs such as
<i>per-u-gu</i>, &ldquo;to become increased&rdquo;; <i>per-u-kku</i>, &ldquo;to cause to increase,&rdquo;
and so on.</p>

<p>Many bases can be used at will as nouns, as adjectives, and as
verbs. Thus the Tamil <i>ka&#7693;u</i> can mean &ldquo;sharpness,&rdquo; &ldquo;sharp,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;to be sharp.&rdquo; Other bases are of course more restricted in their
respective spheres.</p>

<p>The inflection of words is effected by agglutination, <i>i.e.</i> various
additions are suffixed to the base in order to form what we would
call cases and tenses. Such additions have probably once been
separate words. Most of them are, however, now only used as
suffixes. Thus from the Tamil base <i>k&#333;n</i>, &ldquo;king,&rdquo; we can form an
accusative <i>k&#333;n-ei</i>, a verb <i>k&#333;n-en</i>, &ldquo;I am king,&rdquo; and so on.</p>

<p>Dravidian nouns are divided into two classes, which Tamil grammarians
called high-caste and casteless respectively. The former
includes those nouns which denote beings endowed with reason,
the latter all others. Gender is only distinguished in the former
class, while all casteless nouns are neuter. The gender of animals
(which are irrational) must accordingly be distinguished by using
different words for the male and the female, or else by adding words
meaning male, female, respectively, to the name of the animal&mdash;processes
which do not, strictly speaking, fall under the head of
grammar.</p>

<p>There are two numbers, the singular and the plural. The latter
is formed by adding suffixes. It, however, often remains unmarked
in the case of casteless nouns.</p>

<p>Cases are formed by adding postpositions and suffixes, usually
to a modified form of the noun which is commonly called the oblique
base. Thus we have the Tamil <i>maram</i>, &ldquo;tree&rdquo;; <i>maratt-&#257;l</i>, &ldquo;from
a tree&rdquo;; <i>maratt-u-kku</i>, &ldquo;to a tree&rdquo;; <i>v&#299;&#7693;u</i>, &ldquo;a house&rdquo;; <i>v&#299;&#7789;&#7789;-&#257;l</i>,
&ldquo;from a house.&rdquo; The case terminations are the same in the singular
and in the plural. The genitive, which precedes the governing noun,
is often identical with the oblique base, or else it is formed by adding
suffixes.</p>

<p>The numeral system is decimal and higher numbers are counted in
tens; thus Tamil <i>pattu</i>, &ldquo;ten&rdquo;; <i>iru-badu</i>, &ldquo;two tens,&rdquo; &ldquo;twenty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The personal pronoun of the first person in most dialects has a
double form in the plural, one including and the other excluding the
person addressed. Thus, Tamil <i>n&#257;m</i>, &ldquo;we,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> I and you; <i>n&#257;&#7749;gal</i>,
&ldquo;we,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> I and they.</p>

<p>There is no relative pronoun. Relative clauses are effected by
using relative participles. Thus in Telugu the sentence &ldquo;the book
which you gave to me&rdquo; must be translated <i>m&#299;ru n&#257;ku iccina pus-takamu</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;you me-to given book.&rdquo; There are several such
participles in use. Thus from the Telugu verb <i>ko&#7789;&#7789;a</i>, &ldquo;to strike,&rdquo;
are formed <i>ko&#7789;&#7789;-ut-unna</i>, &ldquo;that strikes,&rdquo; <i>ko&#7789;&#7789;-i-na</i>, &ldquo;that struck,&rdquo;
<i>ko&#7789;&#7789;&#275;</i>, &ldquo;that would strike,&rdquo; &ldquo;that usually strikes.&rdquo; By adding
pronouns, or the terminations of pronouns, to such forms, nouns are
derived which denote the person who performs the action. Thus
from Telugu <i>ko&#7789;&#7789;&#275;</i> and <i>v&#257;&#7693;u</i>, &ldquo;he,&rdquo; is formed <i>ko&#7789;&#7789;&#275;-v&#257;&#7693;u</i>, &ldquo;one who
usually strikes.&rdquo; Such forms are used as ordinary verbs, and the
usual verbal forms of Dravidian languages can broadly be described
as such nouns of agency. Thus, the Telugu, <i>ko&#7789;&#7789;in&#257;&#7693;u</i>, &ldquo;he struck,&rdquo;
can be translated literally &ldquo;a striker in the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Verbal tenses distinguish the person and number of the subject
by adding abbreviated forms of the personal pronouns. Thus in
Kanarese we have <i>m&#257;&#7693;id-enu</i>, &ldquo;I did&rdquo;; <i>m&#257;&#7693;id-i</i>, &ldquo;thou didst&rdquo;;
<i>m&#257;&#7693;id-evu</i>, &ldquo;we did&rdquo;; <i>m&#257;&#7693;id-aru</i>, &ldquo;they did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the most characteristic features of the Dravidian verb
is the existence of a separate negative conjugation. It usually has
only one tense and is formed by adding the personal terminations
to a negative base. Thus, Kanarese <i>m&#257;&#7693;-enu</i>, &ldquo;I did not&rdquo;; <i>m&#257;&#7693;-evu</i>,
&ldquo;we did not&rdquo;; <i>m&#257;&#7693;-aru</i>, &ldquo;they did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vocabulary has adopted numerous Aryan loan-words. This
was a necessary consequence of the early connexion with the superior
Aryan civilization.</p>

<p>The oldest Dravidian literature is largely indebted to the Aryans
though it goes back to a very early date. Tamil, Malay&#257;lam,
Kanarese and Telugu are the principal literary languages. The
language of literature in all of them differs considerably from the
colloquial. The oldest known specimen of a Dravidian language
occurs in a Greek play which is preserved in a papyrus of the
2nd century <span class="sc">a.d.</span> The exact period to which the indigenous literature
can be traced back, on the other hand, has not been fixed with
certainty.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRAWBACK<a name="ar12" id="ar12"></a></span>, in commerce, the paying back of a duty previously
paid upon the exportation of excisable articles or upon the
re-exportation of foreign goods. The object of a drawback is to
enable commodities which are subject to taxation to be exported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page552" id="page552"></a>552</span>
and sold in a foreign country on the same terms as goods from
countries where they are untaxed. It differs from a bounty in
that the latter enables commodities to be sold abroad at less
than their cost price; it may occur, however, under certain
conditions that the giving of a drawback has an effect equivalent
to that of a bounty, as in the case of the so-called sugar bounties
in Germany (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sugar</a></span>). The earlier tariffs contained elaborate
tables of the drawbacks allowed on the exportation or re-exportation
of commodities, but so far as the United Kingdom
is concerned the system of &ldquo;bonded warehouses&rdquo; practically
abolished drawbacks, as commodities can be warehoused (placed
&ldquo;in bond&rdquo;) until required for subsequent exportation.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRAWING<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span>, in art. Although the verb &ldquo;to draw&rdquo; has various
meanings, the substantive <i>drawing</i> is confined by usage to its
artistic sense, delineation or design. The word &ldquo;draw,&rdquo; from a
root common to the Teutonic languages (Goth, <i>dragan</i>, O.H.G.
<i>drahan</i>, Mod. Ger. <i>tragen</i>, which all have the sense of &ldquo;carry,&rdquo;
O. Norse <i>draga</i>, A.S. <i>drazan</i>, <i>drazen</i>, &ldquo;draw,&rdquo; cf. Lat. <i>trahere</i>),
means to pull or &ldquo;drag&rdquo; (a word of the same origin) as distinct
from the action of pushing. It is thus used of traction generally,
whether by men, animals or machines. The same idea is preserved
in &ldquo;drawing&rdquo; as applied to the fine arts. We do not
usually say, or think, that a sculptor is drawing when he is using
his chisel, although he may be expressing or defining forms,
nor that an engraver is drawing when he is pushing the burin
with the palm of the hand, although the result may be the
rendering of a design. But we do say that an artist is drawing
when he uses the lead pencil, and here we have a motion bearing
some resemblance to that of traction generally. The action of
the artist in drawing the pencil point with his fingers along the
paper is analogous, <i>e.g.</i>, to that of a horse or man drawing a
pole over soft ground and leaving a mark behind. The same
analogy may be observed between two of the senses in which the
<span class="correction" title="amended from Frech">French</span> verb <i>tirer</i> is frequently employed. This word, the origin
of which is quite uncertain, was formerly used by good writers
in the two senses of the verb to draw. Thus Lafontaine says,
&ldquo;Six forts chevaux <i>tiraient</i> un coche&rdquo;; and Caillières wrote,
&ldquo;Il n&rsquo;y a pas longtemps que je me suis fait <i>tirer</i> par Rigaud,&rdquo;
meaning that Rigaud had drawn or painted his portrait. At the
present day the verb <i>tirer</i> has fallen into disuse amongst cultivated
Frenchmen with regard to drawing and painting, but it is
still universally used for all kinds of design and even for photography
by the common people. The cultivated use it still for
printing, as for example &ldquo;cette gravure sera tirée à cent exemplaires,&rdquo;
in the sense of pulling. A verb much more nearly
related to the English verb <i>to draw</i> is the French <i>traire</i> (Lat.
<i>trahere</i>), which has <i>trait</i> for its past participle. <i>Traire</i> is now
used exclusively for milking cows and other animals, and though
the analogy between this and artistic drawing is not obvious at
first, nevertheless there is a certain analogy of motion, since the
hand passing down the teat draws the milk downwards. The
word <i>trait</i> is much more familiar in connexion with art as &ldquo;les
traits du visage,&rdquo; the natural markings of the face, and it is very
often used in a figurative sense, as we say &ldquo;traits of character.&rdquo;
It is familiar in the English <i>portrait</i>, derived from <i>protrahere</i>.
The ancient Romans used words which expressed more clearly
the conception that drawing was done in line (<i>delineare</i>) or in
shade (<i>adumbrare</i>), though there are reasons for believing that
the words were often indiscriminately applied. Although the
modern Italians have both <i>traire</i> and <i>trarre</i>, they use <i>delineare</i>
still <span class="correction" title="amended from 'is'">in</span> the sense of artistic drawing, and also <i>adombrare</i>. The
Greek verb <span class="grk" title="graphein">&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span> appears in English in &ldquo;graphic&rdquo; and in
many compounds, such as photograph, &amp;c. It is worth observing
that the Greeks seem to have considered drawing and writing
(<i>q.v.</i>) as essentially the same process, since they used the same
word for both. This points to the early identity of the two arts
when drawing was a kind of writing, and when such writing as
men had learned to practise was essentially what we should
call drawing, though of a rude and simple kind. Even in the
present day picture writing is not unfrequently resorted to by
travellers as a means of making themselves intelligible. There
is also a kind of art which is writing in the modern sense and
drawing at the same time, such as the work of the medieval
illuminators in their manuscripts.</p>
<div class="author">(X.)</div>

<p><i>The Art of Drawing.</i>&mdash;Rather than attempt here a historical
survey of the various so-called &ldquo;styles&rdquo; of drawing, or write a
personal appreciation of them, it seems of greater use to give a
logical account of drawing as an art, applicable to all times and
countries. Reference to the teaching of drawing will be occasionally
given rather to illustrate the argument than with a view to
its being of practical use.</p>

<p>At the outset a distinction must be made between drawing as
a means of symbolic or literary expression and drawing as the
direct and only means of expressing the beauty of form. If
Pharaoh wants to have it known that a hundred ducks were
consumed at one meal in his court, he employs a draughtsman
to register the fact on a frieze by picturing a row of cooks occupied
in preparing the hundred ducks. The artist in this case does not
represent the scene as he must have known it in the kitchen,
with all its variety of movement and composition (as an early
Greek vase painter conceived the interior of a vase factory),
but all he does and is required to do is to give the sufficient
number of figures and ducks. The more uniform the figures the
greater will be the effect of number. Drawing has been employed
here to tell a story, and it succeeds in so far as it tells the spectator
plainly what could be told, perhaps less conveniently, in words.
It matters not whether the figures and objects be feelingly
rendered and harmoniously composed. So, to-day, a child, or
any one who has a simple trick of symbolizing figures and objects
in nature, can describe any event or moral by this process,
provided the plot be not too elaborate to be expressed by a
scene, or series of scenes, enacted by dumb symbolic figures.
It is plain that the amusing pictures in <i>Punch</i> or <i>Fliegende
Blätter</i> would be none the more amusing if they were done by the
hand of Michelangelo, nor would the mystic designs of Blake
be more full of meaning if drawn by Rembrandt, for in neither
case do these works depend upon any subtle rendering of the
forms of nature for their success, but upon the dramatic or
intellectual imagination of the man who conceived them. When
the witty or ethical man is at the same time a master draughtsman
his work has two values, the &ldquo;literary&rdquo; content and the
beauty of his drawing of natural objects. But it must be borne
in mind that these values are fundamentally distinct; so much
so that the spectator who has no appreciation of the forms of
nature enjoys the story told and remains blind to the qualities
of draughtsmanship, whilst the lover of nature&rsquo;s forms may or
may not trouble to unravel the literary plot but finds perfect
satisfaction in the drawing. By far the greater part of illustration,
and of artistic production generally, must be classed as
symbolic art. Magazine stories to-day are sometimes illustrated
even by photography, for the hand of the artist is not required.
Symbolic art describes indirectly and in a necessarily limited
scope what literature can do directly and with unlimited powers.
The only content of symbolic drawing is its literary meaning;
as drawing it may be quite worthless.</p>

<p>Pure drawing, however, whether it represent a dramatic
event or a knee-joint, has a content that cannot be expressed
by words, and is not necessarily directed towards literary expression.
Just as a fragment of good sculpture pleases the
connoisseur without any reference either to the whole original
or to its spiritual significance, fine drawing can appeal to the
lover of nature independently of indirect considerations.</p>

<p>What is the content of pure drawing? It is held by some
that drawing or monochrome can suggest colour, and many
people, some consciously, others unconsciously, attempt to
represent in drawings the colours of figures and landscape. It
seems a strange aberration to argue that by different intensities
of the one colour various other colours can be suggested: it
would not be more unreasonable to maintain that E flat and F
could be suggested by striking the note G with varying strength.
Now the draughtsman employs various intensities of his monochrome
as light and shade by which to give roundness to his
forms. But if on the same drawing he uses the same means in
his attempt to express colour, a conflict would be at once set up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page553" id="page553"></a>553</span>
between that which makes for form and that which would make for colour,
and the result would generally be a confusion. Again, let one attempt to
give red hair to a monochrome drawing of a man, and if the red be plain
and unmistakable to all who are not the artist&rsquo;s accomplices, then the
artist has succeeded; otherwise it is bootless to treat of colour and
colour values (which of course must depend upon the existence of colour)
in monochrome. Apart from theory, if we examine the drawings, etchings
and monochromes of great artists, where do we find them attempting to
give colour or colour values? The hundreds of costume studies by
Rembrandt might have been done from white plaster models, and there are
only a few exceptions where a man has, for instance, a black hat or
cloak. But in these few instances the &ldquo;colour&rdquo; tone is applied with such
discretion that the true representation of the form is scarcely, perhaps
only theoretically, impaired: they certainly have gained nothing in
colour value because no specific colour is manifest in them. In
Rembrandt&rsquo;s, Claude&rsquo;s or Turner&rsquo;s drawings of landscapes the formation
of the country, the architecture, &amp;c., is expressed by line, light and
shade, and enhanced by shadows cast from clouds and trees. If, in the
drawings of masters, we should find objects darker or lighter than their
position in the light would warrant, they have value (perhaps not quite
a legitimate one) for balancing the composition as a flat pattern. They
were never intended to suggest colour, nor do they. Yet, in spite of the
failure to succeed, and contrary to logical argument and the practice of
great draughtsmen, the student of most of the schools of Europe and
America still persists in doing the hair dark, and, by attempting to
give colour values to the clothes, breaks up the consistency of the
whole. For the same reason that the sculptor uses uniformly coloured
material in order that the natural light and shade may have full
opportunity of making his forms manifest to the spectator, the
draughtsman confines himself to giving light and shade only. If a
monochrome has &ldquo;colour tones,&rdquo; the effect is similar to that produced by
a draped statue made out of variously coloured marbles&mdash;an inartistic
jumble.</p>

<p>As the immediate purpose and content of drawing there remains the
representation of form only. Drawing is, therefore, essentially the same
activity as sculpture, and has no additional scope. &ldquo;Pupils,&rdquo; says
Donatello, &ldquo;I give you the whole art of sculpture when I tell you to
draw&rdquo; (cited by Holroyd, <i>Michel Angelo</i>, p. 2 95), and the only
practical teaching of drawing might be summed up by the inversion of the
above.</p>

<p>Now if everything in nature&mdash;men, mountains or clouds&mdash;were as flat
targets, <i>i.e.</i> two-dimensional, drawing could be legitimately reduced to
a mechanical process,&mdash;to trace their contours upon a glass screen or
even photograph them would be all that would be required. Indeed,
provided the size of the drawing, the local colour and the texture be
the same as those of the original, a complete illusion would be the
result, in fact the proper end of one&rsquo;s labours. But the presence of the
third dimension in all objects causes light and shade, which in their
turn bring about radical changes of the local colour, even in uniformly
coloured objects. Now since drawing cannot suggest colour, local or
atmospherical, any attempt to effect an illusion by a monochrome is at
once defeated. If the end of drawing were to approach imitation or
illusion as nearly as possible, how is it that a mere &ldquo;sketch&rdquo; by a
master draughtsman can be for itself as valuable as his highly finished
drawing? And surely a masterly outline drawing of a figure or landscape
does not pretend to be an illusion. If then the draughtsman does not,
and cannot hope to imitate nature, he is compelled to state only his
ideas of it, ideas of three-dimensional form. For this reason only
drawing must be treated as an art, and not as a mechanical act of
getting an illusion.</p>

<p>It is interesting to trace in the history of an indigenous art the
development of drawing that shall ultimately express ideas of
three-dimensional form. Prof. Emanuel Loewy, in his <i>Rendering of Nature
in Early Greek Art</i>, demonstrates how the early Greek sculpture (and
that of all primitive peoples, children and ungifted artists) shows an
aversion from depth. Their reliefs are of the flattest description,
almost raised contours, and their figures in the round have at first
only one aspect, or flat façade, so to speak, then three and four
aspects, and finally at the date of Lysippus the figures are fully
rounded out, and the members project at liberty in all directions. Then
for the first time Greek sculpture showed a complete conception of the
body&rsquo;s corporeity (<i>Körperlichkeit</i>). The primitive artist, however well
he may be <i>intellectually</i> aware of the three dimensions of an object,
does not fully apprehend its true aspect as offered to the eye from one
point of view. Following this conclusion, it is easy to see also in the
drawing of the early Greeks, children and so on, the same lack of idea
of the third dimension. The figures on the vases of the &ldquo;finest period&rdquo;
(about 475 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>), despite occasional foreshortenings, have, when
considered as representations of solid forms, a papery appearance. They
have not half the draughtsmanship shown by the latter period of the vase
industry, where the figures, though careless, stereotyped and
ill-composed, come forwards (to use Prof. Loewy&rsquo;s description of later
sculpture), go backwards, twist and turn in space in a manner which
cannot be excelled. The reproductions in figs. 1, 2, 3 will illustrate
the development. The primitive draughtsman is at first bound by the
silhouette. Later, he desires to fill out the interior, but this cannot
be done without in great part modifying his contour lines, because they
are generally merely indications of the disappearing and reappearing
inner modelling, <i>i.e.</i> of the figure&rsquo;s third dimension. Finally, the
draughtsman in full possession of a feeling for the corporeity of the
object will determine his contour entirely from within, a procedure
which is the exact opposite to that of his first beginnings. He
conceives the length, breadth and depth of an object and all its parts
as solid wholes. To him a body in violent foreshortening is as easy as a
simple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page554" id="page554"></a>554</span>
profile, and, though it may not be as attractive, it is perhaps
more interesting because its contours are more bound up with,
and dependent upon, the inner modelling; in other words, it has
more depth. The draughtsman&rsquo;s idea of a form in nature is
not a &ldquo;flat idea,&rdquo; but one containing three dimensions. This
idea he seeks to express either by line alone or by light and shade.
If an artist has not a three-dimensional &ldquo;grasp&rdquo; of forms,
and, like a child, confines himself to the primitive tracing of the
silhouette, his compositions may be of excellent flat pattern,
and equal to any of the designs of ancient carpets or early Greek
vases; but in the light of the above argument, and when compared
with the productions of mature draughtsmen of all ages and
countries, they cannot be said to be complete drawings, any
more than the early unifacial statues of the Greeks can be called
true plastic, simply because in neither case has the artist yet
reached the highest possible development of corporeous conception,
by which truly to interpret the solid objects of nature as
we know them, and as master draughtsmen see them.</p>

<p>An attempt should be made to explain the psycho-physiological
process that must take place in the mind of the real
draughtsman. When we look at an object in nature we know
its length and breadth by the flat image on the retina; we see
also the light and shade, which at once gives us a correct idea
of the object&rsquo;s depth or relief. But we do not, nor could we,
have this idea from the flat image on the retina alone, <i>i.e.</i> from
the mere perception of the light and shade: our knowledge of
its depth is the result of experience, <i>i.e.</i> of our having from
infancy remarked a certain dispensation of light and shade on,
and peculiar to, every form we have touched or traversed, and
so, by association and inference, being early enabled to have
ideas of the depth of things by their various arrangements of
lights and darks without having to touch or traverse them.
Nevertheless the act (generally, but by no means always, an
unconscious one) of visually touching a form must necessarily
take place before we can apprehend the third dimension of a form.
It is, then, by the combination of the ideas derived from pure
vision and the ideas derived from touch that we know the
length, breadth and depth of a solid form. We have shown that
the art of drawing is not an imitation, but an expression of the
artist&rsquo;s ideas of form; therefore all drawing of forms that merely
reproduces the image on the retina, and leaves unconsulted
the ideas of touch, is incomplete and primitive, because it does
not express a conception of form which is the result of an association
of the two senses; in other words, it does not contain an idea
of the object&rsquo;s relief or solidity. And all teaching of drawing
that does not impress upon the student the necessity of combining
the sense of vision with that of touch is erroneous, for it is
thereby limiting him to a mechanical task, viz. the tracing of the
flat image on the retina, which could be equally well done by
mechanical means, or by photography alone.</p>

<p>In most of the schools of Europe and America it is true that
great stress is laid upon the importance of giving life-like relief to
drawings, but the
method by which
the students are
allowed to get
the relief is by
employing the
sense of vision
only. Tracing the
silhouette of the
figure as minutely as possible, they then fill it out with inner-modelling,
which also is done by vision alone, for the lights
and darks of the original are copied down as so many flat
patterns fitted together and gradated like a child&rsquo;s puzzle,
and are not used merely as indication by which to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; the
depth of the object. Such a procedure is as if in drawing a
brick of which three sides were visible, one were first to draw
the entire contour (fig. 4, a), the subtle perspective of which he
might get correct with some mechanical apparatus or by infinite
mechanical pains, and then fill up the interior with its &ldquo;shading&rdquo;
(fig. 4, b). The method would be plainly laborious, unintelligent
and unedifying, and in drawing the most complicated foreshortened
forms of the human body it would seem still more
illogical. That this principle of instruction does not help the
student to grasp the three-dimensional character properly can
be proved by the twenty-minute studies of the average student
who in his fourth year has won a gold medal for an astounding
piece of life-like stippling. They are still unintelligent contour
tracings, as if of cardboard figures, with a few irrelevant patches
of dark here and there within the silhouette.</p>

<p>But high modelling that would make for illusion of reality is not
the first aim of draughtsmanship, nor have the best draughtsmen
employed it save by exception. Michelangelo, Ingres, Holbein
and Rembrandt have shown us that it is possible to give sufficient
relief with a mere outline drawing. Again, the desire for salience
often blunts the student&rsquo;s sense of the real character of the forms
he is rounding out. So his elaborately modelled portrait may
look very &ldquo;life-like,&rdquo; but when compared with the original it will
generally be seen that the whole and each of the individual forms
of the drawing lack the peculiar character of those of the original.
It is by carefully watching for the character of each fresh variety
in figure and feature that great draughtsmen have excelled, and
not by &ldquo;life-like&rdquo; relief, or even a sophisticated exposition of
anatomical details at the expense of character. Can it be
seriously maintained that a masterly sudden grasp of true formal
character can be developed in a student by a system in which he
patiently spends many days and weeks in stippling into plastic
appearance one drawing which has originally been &ldquo;laid in&rdquo; by a
mechanical process?</p>

<p>It has been shown that to attempt to make an illusion of nature
is neither within the power of monochrome nor has been the
chief aim of draughtsmen, but that the art of drawing consists in
giving a plain statement of one&rsquo;s ideas, be they slight or studied,
of the solid forms of nature. But the question may still be asked:
Why is it that a rigorously accurate and finished drawing by a
student or artist with <i>no</i> such ideas or conception is not good
drawing, containing as it must do all that can be seen in the
original, missing only its complete illusion? Why, in a word, is
not a photograph a work of art?</p>

<p>The common explanation of the above important question is
that the artist &ldquo;selects and eliminates from the forms of nature.&rdquo;
But surely this is the principle of the caricaturist and virtuoso?
A beautiful drawing, however slight, is but the precipitate of the
whole in the artist&rsquo;s mind. And a highly finished drawing by a
master does not show even any apparent selection or elimination.
The adoption of the principle of selection to differentiate art from
mechanical reproduction is fundamentally vicious, and could be
shown to be wholly inapplicable to the so-called formative arts.
Nor could the theory of &ldquo;selection&rdquo; be used as a principle of
teaching, for if to the first question the pupil would make, &ldquo;What
am I to select?&rdquo; it were answered, &ldquo;Only the important things,&rdquo;
then the next question, &ldquo;What are the important things?&rdquo; could
be answered only by saying, &ldquo;That alone the real artist knows,
but cannot teach.&rdquo; Certainly there are important things that
can be taught the student in the initial stage of &ldquo;laying-in&rdquo; a
figure, but <i>when</i> to begin selecting or eliminating no teacher
could tell him, simply because he must be aware that a true
draughtsman can afford to eliminate nothing when the truth of
the whole is at stake. The artist&rsquo;s conception and its expression
may be slight or elaborate, but in neither case can selection or
elimination take place, for a true conception must be founded
upon the character of the whole, which is determined by the
entire complex of all the parts.</p>

<p>To explain the essential difference between art and mechanical
drawing or mechanical reproduction, a more applicable theory
must be found. Compare the art of telling a story. If, to
describe an incident in the street you had the entire affair reenacted
on the same spot, you would have but made a mechanical
reproduction of it, leaving the spectator to simplify the affair, and
construct his <i>own</i> conception of it. You have not given <i>your</i>
ideas of the event, and so you have not made a work of art. So, if
a man draws an object detail for detail by any mechanical
process, or traces over its photograph, he has but reduplicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page555" id="page555"></a>555</span>
the real aspect of the object, and has failed to give the spectator a
simple and intelligible idea of it. Starting out with the generous
notion of giving all, that there may be &ldquo;something for everyone,&rdquo;
he has given nothing. He did not originally form an intelligible
and simplified idea of the figure, so how can his drawing be
expected to give one to others?</p>

<p>But how can forms be made <i>more</i> simple and intelligible than
by reproducing their aspect with absolute accuracy? Our
combined sense of vision and touch comprehends very easily
certain elementary solid forms, the sphere, the cube, the pyramid
and the cylinder. No forms but these, and their modifications,
can be apprehended by the mind in one and the same act of
vision. Every complex form, even so simple as that of a kidney,
for instance, must be first broken up into its component parts
before it can be fully apprehended or remembered. Analogously
with the above, Prof. Wundt has shown how the mind can
apprehend <i>as separate units</i> any number, of marbles for instance,
up to five, after which every number must be split up into lots of
twos, threes, fours and fives, or twenties, thirties and so on,
before it can realize the full content of that number in one and the
same mental picture. So the only way to receive an intelligible
idea of a complex form, such as a human figure, is first to discover
in the figure itself, and then in all its parts, only modifications of
the above elementary solid forms, and the drawing of a conception
thus informed must needs be a very clear and intelligible
one. The more the artist is capable and practised, the more
clearly will he conceive and distinguish in nature each subtle
modification of these elementary forms, their direction, their
relation to, and their dependence upon one another. The only
difference between a good draughtsman and a bad one is the
degree of subtlety of his apprehension. Unless the draughtsman
has seen some such clear forms in his original, his labour to
produce a work of art will be grievous and fruitless. All good
drawing is stamped with this kind of structural insight. The
more the artist adheres to nature, and the more finished his
drawing, the more will the lines and forms that he makes be, so to
speak, <i>in excess</i> of those of nature, or dull imitation or photography.
It is not to be supposed that able draughtsmen work, or
need ever have worked, consciously in this manner. It is,
indeed, the virtue peculiar to the artist, as interpreter of form,
that he instinctively comprehends the real elemental character of
complex forms, whilst the majority of people (on the showing of
their own drawings) entertain but confused or <i>no</i> ideas of them.
It is because a good drawing reduces the chaos of ideas supplied
by the raw material of nature, to one intelligible manner of
seeing it, that all lovers of nature welcome it with joy. It is this
process of discovery and interpretation that marks the essential
difference between art and mechanical drawing or reproduction.
Art gives intelligible ideas of the forms of nature, mechanism
attempts to reduplicate their aspects.</p>

<p>There are some who hold that drawing is not exclusively a
matter of interpreting form, but that great artists have their own
&ldquo;personalities&rdquo; which they infuse into their work. They will
ask, How is it otherwise to be explained that two equally good
draughtsmen will invariably make different drawings of the same
figure? Is it not for the same reason that one man will divide up
a row of eight marbles into groups of four, and another into five
and three? The subjectivity of experience governs the different
conceptions that good draughtsmen will form of the same object.
Accordingly as a draughtsman feels form so will he draw it, and it
is only because our sense apparatuses are more or less similarly
constituted that we can understand and appreciate one another&rsquo;s
conceptions.</p>

<p>But if the master draughtsman gives the true character of
his model&rsquo;s form, why is it that his drawings are not pleasing to
all alike? Whence the doubts and criticism that have been
called forth by all original artists? If we first examine the
attitude of the average man, artist or layman, towards nature,
we can better explain his attitude towards works of art. The
average man or artist has not a highly developed appreciation of
form <i>per se</i>, whether it be the form of natural or manufactured
objects. And it would seem that he is still less a disinterested
spectator of the forms and features of his fellow beings and
animals, their movements, their colour, their value in a room or
landscape. He has sentimental, moral or intellectual preferences.
In other words, he likes or dislikes only those faces or
figures which hundreds of personal associations have taught
him to like or dislike. The riding man&rsquo;s admiration for the look
of a particular horse is based upon the fact that it looks like &ldquo;a
horse to go,&rdquo; and hence it is what he calls beautiful, while the
artist, in the capacity of artist and not of sportsman, is not
particular in his choice of horse-flesh, but finds each animal
equally interesting for itself alone. Consequently in art any face,
figure or object that does not come into the category of what
the average man cares for is condemned by him even as it would
be in real life, since he is no lover of form for form&rsquo;s sake, but
provided the subject or moral be pleasing the quality of the
draughtsmanship is of small account. The picture of a dwarf,
or of an anatomy lesson, or of a group of ordinary bourgeois
folk would not really please him, even though he were told that
the work was by Velazquez, Rembrandt or Manet. We have
only to listen to the common criticism of works of art to know
that it is founded upon personal predilection only. We do not
hear such personal criticism upon drawings of landscape, not
because artists do them better, but because natural landscape
has no interest for any one other than for its form, or, at least,
people do not hold such definite personal likes or dislikes with
regard to its various manifestations. But the artist, though his
own personal predilections may, and generally do, lead him to
work within that agreeable <i>milieu</i>, has, in the capacity of artist,
no subjective prejudices; indeed, if he had them, he could not
represent them by line, light and shade. He seeks always new
varieties of form; hence his subjects, and his manner of posing
them, are often unpleasing to the man who is busy with other
affairs, and has no great experience of nature&rsquo;s forms. Let a good
draughtsman make a successful likeness of the mother of some
average man, and the latter will be delighted, but it by no means
follows that he will delight in a drawing of the wife of the artist,
though done by the same hand and with equal skill.</p>

<p>If drawing is the art of giving one&rsquo;s ideas of the forms of
nature, then all criticism of drawing must be based upon the
question, &ldquo;How far does such and such a work show an intimate
knowledge of or intelligent visualization of the forms we know
in nature?&rdquo; and no other principle of judgment can be applicable
to all drawing alike. Hence only those who have by natural
endowment a clear sense of the forms of things, and who have
made more than ordinary study of them, are in a position to
apply to drawings the above criterion with any approach to
infallibility. It is a fact that there are, and always have been,
a certain number of people who agree perfectly in their appreciation
of the works of certain draughtsmen of different times and
countries, and who can state reasons for their appreciation in
definite and almost identical terms, for it is based upon knowledge
and experience. To such people all fine draughtsmanship owes
its public fame, and its immortality lies in their safe keeping.</p>

<p>It may be argued that each has a right to his own opinion
about form and its representation, on the supposed ground that
we all see form in different ways. But there is a fallacy in this
argument. If we take the average man&rsquo;s drawing of any form
more complex than a loaf of bread as a fair and only testimony
of his power of visualization of forms, we must conclude that most
of us see not differently, but <i>wrongly</i>, or rather confusedly and
disconnectedly, and that some can visualize form scarcely at all.
If this be true, the average person&rsquo;s sight and ability to judge
drawing is seriously diminished. If, then, drawing can be judged
and appreciated only by knowledge and experience of the forms
of nature, no critical formula could be made out so as to enable
a child or savage or ordinary civilized adult to estimate or enjoy
it. If it be argued that drawings are to be judged from some
abstract or symbolic point of view, independently of its subtle
representation of form, then incompetent drawing might be as
beautiful as the competent, which would be absurd. However,
if the competent characterization of form were admitted as at
least the first condition of beautiful drawing, it would follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page556" id="page556"></a>556</span>
that any abstract value it might have must be wholly dependent
upon the manner in which form is represented, and so it would
be superfluous to judge it by any standard other than the direct,
definite and concrete one of form. Abstract beauty, since no
one has yet defined it agreeably to all, is, apparently, with those
who affect a feeling for it, a matter of individual taste, and
therefore cannot be questioned. But the clear visualization of
the forms of nature is based upon a special endowment and
knowledge, and can be criticized by demonstration. People
may differ in their tastes, but they may not, nor do they, differ
upon questions of real knowledge. Drawing, as the activity of
giving one&rsquo;s ideas of form, must therefore be judged not by taste
but by knowledge.</p>

<p>In view of the purpose and content of drawing as here demonstrated,
there is no other principle of judgment that is relevant.
Yet we often hear drawing judged by criteria which are founded
upon no such concrete base but upon certain vague abstractions;
or, again, upon a literary or moral base which could be applicable
only to symbolic art.</p>

<p>It is said that this or that draughtsman excels in &ldquo;beauty of
line.&rdquo; Now in spite of the labours of many painters and theorists,
it cannot reasonably be held that one purely abstract line or
curve is more beautiful than another, for the simple reason that
people have no common ground upon which to establish the
nature of abstract beauty. It may be, however, that even as
certain simple forms are more easily apprehended than complex
ones, there is the same distinction with regard to lines. If then
an artist of clean vision sees in an object of reality such clear
characteristic lines, he draws them not for their abstract beauty,
but merely because by them alone can he express his idea of
the form before him. The early Greek vase painters, and all
great artists of primitive periods, being attracted only by the
silhouette, became very subtle to observe nature&rsquo;s outlines in
their most intelligible character, and to this capacity is due their
&ldquo;beauty of line,&rdquo; and not to any preconceived notion of an
abstract line of perfect beauty, and nowhere will &ldquo;beauty of
line&rdquo; be found on Greek vases, or elsewhere, that is not informed
by, and does not express, a fine conception of nature&rsquo;s contours.
So too in later three-dimensional drawing there is no beauty of
line which does not intelligibly express not only the directions
and angles of the main contour, but the inner modelling, <i>i.e.</i>
the relief of the figure. It is only a superficial judgment that
would prefer one drawing to another, even if both may be equally
good, because the line of one is neat and the other &ldquo;tormented.&rdquo;
Contour being <i>in nature</i> an ideal line between one form and
another, it is illogical to treat it or criticize it in a <i>drawing</i> as an
actual and specific thing, apart from the forms that make it
and are made by it. If an artist drew a dragon with deliberate
disregard for animal construction, his drawing would be silly,
and only by a profound knowledge of the forms of nature could
it be made to have beautiful lines. Truth to nature is always
originality, and it is the only originality worth the name.</p>

<p>Again, some people judge one drawing as better than another
in that it shows more &ldquo;individuality&rdquo; or &ldquo;temperament.&rdquo; Now
a man&rsquo;s individuality is, presumably, a vague feeling in our
minds produced by the net result of the ways in which he sees,
hears, loves, thinks and so on, so that we could not tell a man&rsquo;s
individuality from any single one of his manifestations. With
his entire work as an artist before us, <i>i.e.</i> his manner of seeing,
we could do no more than infer, with the help of outside data,
from the subjects he chooses, and the neatness or boldness of his
line, something about his general character, and that with small
degree of certainty. To regard a man&rsquo;s works of art, or indeed
any of his manifestations, from this point of view, is, after all,
nothing but a kind of inquisitive cheiromancy. Those who
pretend to like the drawings of Watteau or Michelangelo &ldquo;because
they show more individuality&rdquo; than the incompetent work of a
beginner or poor artist cannot be skilled in their own business,
because the lady who tells your character by your handwriting
finds as much individuality in bad writing as in good,&mdash;sometimes
even more. It may be entertaining to some to guess at the
artist&rsquo;s character from his works by this process of inference
and comparison, but it is unreasonable to imagine that &ldquo;individuality,&rdquo;
as such, can be made a serious criterion of aesthetic
judgment. The only individuality a draughtsman can show
directly by his drawing is his individual way of conceiving the
forms of nature, and even this is immaterial provided the
conception and drawing be good.</p>

<p>A word or two are necessary upon &ldquo;style,&rdquo; which unfortunate
word has made much mystery in criticism. The great draughtsmen
of every time and country are known by their own words,
as well as their works, to have been infinitely respectful to the
form of every detail in nature. Their drawings always recall
to our minds reality as we ourselves have seen it (provided we
have studied from nature and not from pictures). The drawing
of a hand, for instance, by Hokusai, Ingres or Dürer, revives
in us our own impressions of the forms and aspects of real hands.
In short there is manifest in all good drawings, whatever their
difference of medium or superficial appearance, an entire dependence
upon the forms of nature. Hence we cannot imagine
that they were conceived and executed with the conscious
effort to obtain some abstract style independent of the material
treated. The style they plainly have can spring from this
common quality, their truthful and well understood representation
of forms. Style, then, is the expression of a clear understanding
of the material from which the artist works. Unless
a drawing shows this understanding it would be as impossible
as it would be gratuitous to argue that it could have style. But
it would seem that some people mean by style nothing more
than the mere superficial appearance of the work. They would
have a draughtsman draw &ldquo;in the style of Holbein,&rdquo; but not
&ldquo;in the style&rdquo; of Rembrandt. This kind of preference, as
remarked above, is superficial, for it overlooks the main issue
and purpose of drawing, viz. the representation, by any means
whatever, of the artist&rsquo;s ideas of form. It is as though one
should prefer a letter from Holbein to one from Rembrandt,
though both were equally expressive, simply because Holbein&rsquo;s
handwriting was prettier than Rembrandt&rsquo;s. Each draughtsman
manifests a kind of handwriting peculiar to himself even in
his most faithful rendering of form; and by this we can immediately
recognize the artist; many, for instance Hogarth and
some Japanese, seem to have let their quirks, full stops
and so on, get the upper hand at the expense of serious,
sensitive draughtsmanship.</p>

<p>It is fair to suppose that all abstract principles of aesthetic
judgment, such as beauty of line, personality, style, nobility
of thought, romanticism, are merely pretexts set up by people
who would still affect to admire the drawings of recognized
masters when they have neither the knowledge of, nor the care
for, the forms of nature by virtue of which alone these drawings
are what they are, and by which alone they can be immediately
appreciated.</p>

<p><i>Drawing-Office Work.</i>&mdash;In modern engineering, few pieces of
mechanism are ever produced in the shops until their design has
been settled in the &ldquo;drawing office,&rdquo; and embodied in suitable
drawings showing general and detailed views. This is a broad
statement to which there are exceptions, to be noted presently.</p>

<p>Drawing-office work is divisible into four principal groups.
First, there is the actual designing, by far the most difficult
work, which is confined to relatively few well-paid men. The
qualifications necessary for it are a good scientific, mathematical
and engineering training, and a specialized experience gathered
in the particular class of mechanism to which the designing
relates. Second, there is the work of the rank and file who take
instructions from the chiefs, and elaborate the smaller details and
complete the drawings. Third, there are the tracers, either
youths or girls, who copy drawings on tracing paper without
necessarily understanding them. Fourth, there is a printing
department in which phototypes are produced on sensitized
paper from tracings.</p>

<p>The character of the drawings used includes the general
drawings, or those which show a mechanism complete; and the
detailed drawings, which illustrate portions isolated from their
connexions and relationships. The first are retained in the office
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page557" id="page557"></a>557</span>
for reference, and copies are only sent out to the men who have to
assemble or erect and complete mechanisms. The second are
distributed to the several shops and departments where sectional
portions are being prepared, as pattern shop, smithy, turnery,
machine shop, &amp;c. General drawings are, as a rule, drawn to a
small scale, ranging say from <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. to 1 in. to the foot; but
details are either to actual size, or to a large scale, as from 1½ in.
to the foot or 3 in. or 6 in. to the foot.</p>

<p>A large number of minutiae are omitted from general drawings,
but in the detailed ones that are sent into the shops nothing is
apparently too trivial for insertion. In this respect, however,
there is much difference observable in the practice of different
firms, and in the best practice of the present compared with that
of former years. In the detailed drawings issued by many firms
now, every tiny element and section is not only drawn to actual
size, but also fully dimensioned, and the material to be used is
specified in every case. This practice largely adds to the work of
the drawing-office staff, but it pays.</p>

<p>The present tendency therefore is to throw more responsibility
than of old on the drawing-office staff, in harmony with the
tendency towards greater centralization of authority. Much of
detail that was formerly left to the decision of foremen and
skilled hands is now determined by the drawing-office staff.
Heterogeneity in details is thus avoided, and the drawings reflect
accurately and fully the past as well as the present practice of the
firm. To so great an extent is this the case that the preparation
of the tools, appliances, templets, jigs and fixtures used in the
shops is often now not permitted to be undertaken until proper
drawings have been prepared for them, though formerly the
foreman&rsquo;s own hand sketches generally sufficed. The practice of
turret work has been contributory to this result. In many
establishments now the designing of shop tools and fixtures is
done in a department of the office specially set apart for that
kind of work.</p>

<p>The growing specialization of the engineer&rsquo;s work is reflected
in the drawing office. Specialists are sought after, and receive
the highest rates of pay. A man is required to be an expert in
some one branch, as electric cranes or hydraulic machines, steel
works plant, lathes, or heavy or light machine tools. The days
are past in which all-round men were in request. In those firms
which manufacture a large range of machinery, the drawing-office
staff is separated into departments, each under its own
chief, and there is seldom any transference of men from one to
another.</p>

<p>Although in the majority of instances designs and drawings are
completed before the manufacture is undertaken, exceptions to
this rule occur in connexion with the work of standardizing
machines and motors, for repetitive and interchangeable manufacture
on a large scale. Here it is so essential to secure the most
minute economies in manufacture that the first articles made
are of a more or less experimental character. Only after no
further improvement seems for the time being possible are the
drawings made or completed for standard use and reference.
In some modern shops even standardized drawings are scarcely
used, but their place is taken by the templets, jigs and fixtures
which are employed by the workmen as their sole guides in
machining and assembling parts. By the employment of these
aids locations and dimensions are embodied and fixed absolutely
for any number of similar parts; reference to drawings thus
becomes unnecessary, and they therefore fall into disuse.</p>

<p>The mechanical work of the drawing office is confined strictly
to orthographic projections and sections of objects. Perspective
views are of no value, though occasionally an object is
sketched roughly in perspective as an aid to the rapid grasp of an
idea. Drawings involve plans, elevations, and sectional views,
in vertical and angular relations.</p>

<p>There are a good many conventionalities adopted which have
no correspondences in fact, with the object of saving the draughtsman&rsquo;s
time; or else, as in the case of superposition of plans and
sections, to show in one view what would otherwise require two
drawings. Among the convenient conventionalities are the
indications of toothed wheels by their pitch lines only, of screws
by parallel lines and by diagonal shade lines; and of rivets,
bolts and studs by their centres only. The adoption of this
practice never leads to error.</p>

<p>In the preliminary preparation of drawings in pencil no
distinction is made between full or unbroken lines, and dotted
or centre lines, and the actual outlines of the objects. These
differences are made when the inking-in is being done. Indian
or Chinese ink is used, because it does not run when colours are
applied. There are conventional colours used to indicate
different materials. But colouring is not adopted so much as
formerly, because of the practice of making sun prints instead of
the more expensive tracings for the multiplication of drawings.
When tracings are coloured the colour is applied on the back
instead of on the side where the ink lines are drawn.</p>

<p>The economical importance of the printing department of the
drawing office cannot be overestimated. Before its introduction
drawings could only be reproduced by laborious tracing on paper
or cloth, the first being flimsy, the second especially liable to
absorb grease from the hands of the workmen. By the sun
copying processes (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sun Copying</a></span>) any number of prints can be
taken from a single tracing. But even the fickle sun is being
displaced by electricity, so that prints can be made by night as
well as day, on cloudy days as well as on bright ones. Twenty
minutes of bright sunshine is required for a print, but the electric
light produces the same result within five minutes. Prints are
blue, white or brown. The advantage of white is that they can
be coloured. But the majority are blue (white lines on blue
ground). All can be had on stout, thin or medium paper.</p>

<p>An innovation in drawing-office equipment is that of vertical
boards, displacing horizontal or sloping ones. They have the
advantage that the draughtsman is able to avoid a bending
posture at his work. The objection on the ground that the tee-square
must be held up constantly with one hand is overcome by
supporting and balancing it with cords and weights.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRAWING AND QUARTERING,<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> part of the penalty anciently
ordained in England for treason. Until 1870 the full punishment
for the crime was that the culprit be dragged on a hurdle to the
place of execution; that he be hanged by the neck but not till
he was dead; that he should be disembowelled or drawn and his
entrails burned before his eyes; that his head be cut off and his
body divided into four parts or quartered. This brutal penalty
was first inflicted in 1284 on the Welsh prince David, and on
Sir William Wallace a few years later. In Richard III.&rsquo;s reign
one Collingbourne, for writing the famous couplet &ldquo;The Cat, the
Rat and Lovel the Dog, Rule all England under the Hog,&rdquo; was
executed on Tower Hill. Stow says, &ldquo;After having been hanged,
he was cut down immediately and his entrails were then extracted
and thrown into the fire, and all this was so speedily done that
when the executioners pulled out his heart he spoke and said
&rsquo;Jesus, Jesus.&rsquo;&rdquo; Edward Marcus Despard and his six accomplices
were in 1803 hanged, drawn and quartered for conspiring
to assassinate George III. The sentence was last passed (though
not carried out) upon the Fenians Burke and O&rsquo;Brien in 1867.
There is a tradition that Harrison the regicide, after being
disembowelled, rose and boxed the ears of the executioner.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRAWING-ROOM<a name="ar15" id="ar15"></a></span> (a shortened form of &ldquo;with-drawing room,&rdquo;
the longer form being usual in the 16th and 17th centuries), the
English name generally employed for a room used in a dwelling-house
for the reception of company. It originated in the setting
apart of such a room, as the more private and exclusive preserve
of the ladies of the household, to which they withdrew from the
dining-room. The term &ldquo;drawing-room&rdquo; is also used in a special
sense of the formal receptions or &ldquo;courts&rdquo; held by the British
sovereign or his representative, at which ladies are presented, as
distinguished from a &ldquo;levee,&rdquo; at which men are presented.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRAYTON, MICHAEL<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span> (1563-1631), English poet, was born
at Hartshill, near Atherstone, in Warwickshire in 1563. Even
in childhood it was his great ambition to excel in writing verses.
At the age of ten he was sent as page into some great family,
and a little later he is supposed to have studied for some time
at Oxford. Sir Henry Goodere of Powlesworth became his
patron, and introduced him to the countess of Bedford, and for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page558" id="page558"></a>558</span>
several years he was esquire to Sir Walter Aston. How the early
part of his life was spent, however, we possess no means of
ascertaining. It has been surmised that he served in the army
abroad. In 1590 he seems to have come up to London, and to
have settled there.</p>

<p>In 1591 he produced his first book, <i>The Harmony of the Church</i>,
a volume of spiritual poems, dedicated to Lady Devereux. The
best piece in this is a version of the Song of Solomon, executed
with considerable richness of expression. A singular and now
incomprehensible fate befell the book; with the exception of
forty copies, seized by the archbishop of Canterbury, the whole
edition was destroyed by public order. It is probable that he
had come up to town laden with poetic writings, for he published
a vast amount within the next few years. In 1593 appeared
<i>Idea: The Shepherd&rsquo;s Garland</i>, a collection of nine pastorals,
in which he celebrated his own love-sorrows under the poetic
name of Rowland. The circumstances of this passion appear
more distinctly in the cycle of 64 sonnets, published in 1594,
under the title of <i>Idea&rsquo;s Mirror</i>, by which we learn that the lady
lived by the river Ankor in Warwickshire. It appears that he
failed to win his &ldquo;Idea,&rdquo; and lived and died a bachelor. In
1593 appeared the first of Drayton&rsquo;s historical poems, <i>The Legend
of Piers Gaveston</i>, and the next year saw the publication of
<i>Matilda</i>, an epical poem in rhyme royal. It was about this time,
too, that he brought out <i>Endimion and Phoebe</i>, a volume which
he never republished, but which contains some interesting
autobiographical matter, and acknowledgments of literary help
from Lodge, if not from Spenser and Daniel also. In his <i>Fig
for Momus</i>, Lodge has reciprocated these friendly courtesies.
In 1596 Drayton published his long and important poem of
<i>Mortimerades</i>, which deals with the Wars of the Roses, and is a
very serious production in <i>ottava rima</i>. He afterwards enlarged
and modified this poem, and republished it in 1603 under the
title of <i>The Barons&rsquo; Wars</i>. In 1596 also appeared another
historical poem, <i>The Legend of Robert, Duke of Normandy</i>, with
which <i>Piers Gaveston</i> was reprinted. In 1597 appeared <i>England&rsquo;s
Heroical Epistles</i>, a series of historical studies, in imitation of
those of Ovid. These last poems, written in the heroic couplet,
contain some of the finest passages in Drayton&rsquo;s writings.</p>

<p>With the year 1597 the first half of the poet&rsquo;s literary life closes.
He had become famous by this rapid production of volumes, and
he rested on his oars. It would seem that he was much favoured
at the court of Elizabeth, and he hoped that it would be the
same with her successor. But when, in 1603, he addressed a
poem of compliment to James I., on his accession, it was ridiculed,
and his services rudely rejected. His bitterness of spirit found
expression in a satire, <i>The Owl</i>, which he printed in 1604, although
he had no talent in this kind of composition. Not much more
entertaining was his scriptural narrative of <i>Moses in a Map of
his Miracles</i>, a sort of epic in heroics printed the same year.
In 1605 Drayton reprinted his most important works, that is to
say, his historical poems and the <i>Idea</i>, in a single volume which
ran through eight editions during his lifetime. He also collected
his smaller pieces, hitherto unedited, in a volume undated, but
probably published in 1605, under the title of <i>Poems Lyric and
Pastoral</i>; these consisted of odes, eclogues, and a fantastic
satire called <i>The Man in the Moon</i>. Some of the odes are
extremely spirited. In this volume he printed for the first time
the famous <i>Ballad of Agincourt</i>.</p>

<p>He had adopted as early as 1598 the extraordinary resolution
of celebrating all the points of topographical or antiquarian
interest in the island of Great Britain, and on this laborious work
he was engaged for many years. At last, in 1613, the first part
of this vast work was published under the title of <i>Poly-Olbion</i>,
eighteen books being produced, to which the learned Selden
supplied notes. The success of this great work, which has since
become so famous, was very small at first, and not until 1622
did Drayton succeed in finding a publisher willing to undertake
the risk of bringing out twelve more books in a second part.
This completed the survey of England, and the poet, who had
hoped &ldquo;to crown Scotland with flowers,&rdquo; and arrive at last at
the Orcades, never crossed the Tweed. In 1627 he published
another of his miscellaneous volumes, and this contains some
of his most characteristic and exquisite writing. It consists of
the following pieces: <i>The Battle of Agincourt</i>, an historical poem
in <i>ottava rima</i> (not to be confused with his ballad on the same
subject), and <i>The Miseries of Queen Margaret</i>, written in the
same verse and manner; <i>Nimphidia, the Court of Faery</i>, a most
joyous and graceful little epic of fairyland; <i>The Quest of Cinthia</i>
and <i>The Shepherd&rsquo;s Sirena</i>, two lyrical pastorals; and finally
<i>The Moon Calf</i>, a sort of satire. Of these <i>Nimphidia</i> is perhaps
the best thing Drayton ever wrote, except his famous ballad on
the battle of Agincourt; it is quite unique of its kind and full of
rare fantastic fancy.</p>

<p>The last of Drayton&rsquo;s voluminous publications was <i>The Muses&rsquo;
Elizium</i> in 1630. He died in London on the 23rd of December
1631, was buried in Westminster Abbey, and had a monument
placed over him by the countess of Dorset, with memorial lines
attributed to Ben Jonson. Of the particulars of Drayton&rsquo;s life
we know almost nothing but what he himself tells us; he
enjoyed the friendship of some of the best men of the age.
He corresponded familiarly with Drummond; Ben Jonson,
William Browne, George Wither and others were among his
friends. There is a tradition that he was a friend of Shakespeare,
supported by a statement of John Ward, once vicar of Stratford-on-Avon,
that &ldquo;Shakespear, Drayton and Ben Jonson had a
merry meeting, and it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespear
died of a feavour there contracted.&rdquo; In one of his poems, an
&ldquo;elegy&rdquo; or epistle to Mr Henry Reynolds, he has left some
valuable criticisms on poets whom he had known. He was even
engaged in the labour of the dramatists; at least he had a
share, with Munday, Chettle and Wilson, in writing <i>Sir John
Oldcastle</i>, which was printed in 1600. That he was a restless and
discontented, as well as a worthy, man may be gathered from his
own admissions.</p>

<p>The works of Drayton are bulky, and, in spite of the high place
that he holds in critical esteem, it cannot be pretended that he
is much read. For this his ponderous style is much to blame.
The <i>Poly-Olbion</i>, the most famous but far from the most successful
of his writings, is tedious and barren in the extreme.
It was, he tells us, a &ldquo;Herculean toil&rdquo; to him to compose it,
and we are conscious of the effort. The metre in which it is
composed, a couplet of alexandrines, like the French classical
measure, is wholly unsuited to the English language, and becomes
excessively wearisome to the reader, who forgets the learning and
ingenuity of the poet in labouring through the harsh and overgrown
lines. His historical poems, which he was constantly rewriting
and improving, are much more interesting, and often
rise to a true poetic eloquence. His pastorals are brilliant, but
overladen with colour and sweet to insipidity. He is, with the
one magnificent exception of &ldquo;Since there&rsquo;s no help, come let
us kiss and part,&rdquo; which was first printed in 1619, an indifferent
sonneteer. The poet with whom it is most natural to compare
him is Daniel; he is more rough and vigorous, more varied and
more daring than the latter, but Daniel surpasses him in grace,
delicacy and judgment. In their elegies and epistles, however,
the two writers frequently resemble each other. Drayton,
however, approaches the very first poets of the Elizabethan era
in his charming <i>Nimphidia</i>, a poem which inspired Herrick
with his sweet fairy fancies and stands alone of its kind in
English literature; while some of his odes and lyrics are inspired
by noble feeling and virile imagination.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In 1748 a folio edition of Drayton&rsquo;s complete works was published
under the editorial supervision of William Oldys, and again in 1753
there appeared an issue in four volumes. But these were very unintelligently
and inaccurately prepared. A complete edition of
Drayton&rsquo;s works with variant readings was projected by Richard
Hooper in 1876, but was never carried to a conclusion; a volume of
selections, edited by A. H. Bullen, appeared in 1883. See especially
Oliver Elton, <i>Michael Drayton</i> (1906).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DREAM<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (from a root <i>dreug</i>, connected with Germ. <i>trügen</i>, to
deceive), the state of consciousness during sleep; it may also
be defined as a hallucination or illusion peculiarly associated
with the condition of sleep, but not necessarily confined to that
state. In sleep the withdrawal of the mind from the external
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page559" id="page559"></a>559</span>
world is more complete and the objectivity of the dream images
is usually unquestioned, whereas in the waking state the
hallucination is usually recognized as such; we may, however,
be conscious that we are dreaming, and thus in a measure be
aware of the hallucinatory character of our percepts. The
physiological nature of sleep (<i>q.v.</i>; see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Muscle and Nerve</a></span>)
and of dreaming is obscure. As a rule the control over the
voluntary muscles in dreams is slight; the sleep-walker is the
exception and not the rule, and the motor activity represented
in the dream is seldom realized in practice, largely, no doubt,
because we are ignorant, under these circumstances, of the
spatial relations of our bodies. Among the psychological
problems raised by dreams are the condition of attention, which
is variously regarded as altogether absent or as fixed, the extent
of mental control, and the relation of ideas and motor impulses.
There is present in all dreams a certain amount of dissociation
of consciousness, or of obstructed association, which may
manifest itself in the preliminary stage of drowsiness by such
phenomena as the apparent transformation or inversion of the
words of a book. We may distinguish two types of dreams,
(a) representative or centrally initiated, (b) presentative or
due to the stimulation of the end organs of sense. In both cases,
the dream having once been initiated, we are concerned with a
process of reasoning, <i>i.e.</i> the combination of ideas suggested by
resemblances or other associative elements. The false reasoning
of dreams is due in the first place to the absence, to a large extent,
of the memory elements on which our ordinary reasoning
depends, and, secondly, to the absence of sensory elements.</p>

<p><i>Objectivity of Dreams.</i>&mdash;In waking life we distinguish ideas or
mental images from real objects by the fact that we are able
under normal circumstances to dismiss the former at will. In
sleep, on the other hand, we have, in the first place, no real objects
with which to compare the images, which therefore take on a
character of reality comparable to the hallucination of waking
life; moreover, powers of visualization and other faculties are
enhanced in sleep, so that the strength of dream images considerably
exceeds those of the mental images of the ordinary
man; changes in powers of attention, volition and memory
help to increase the hallucinatory force of the dream. In the
second place, the ideas of our dreams are presented in the form
of images, which we are unable to dismiss; we therefore
mistake them for realities, exactly as the sufferer from delirium
tremens in waking life is apt to regard his phantoms as real.</p>

<p><i>Relations of Dreaming and Sleep.</i>&mdash;It has been maintained by
Hamilton and others (see below, Modern Views) that dreams
invariably accompany sleep, and that we always find ourselves
dreaming when we are awakened. But even if it were true
that dreams were invariably experienced at the moment of
waking, this would not by any means establish the invariable
concomitance of dreams and sleep of all sorts; at most it would
show that imperfect sleep is a condition of dreaming; in the
same way, dreams before wakening, known to have taken place
either from the recollection of the dreamer or from the observation
of another person, may clearly be due to imperfect wakening,
followed by a deepening of sleep. It is, however, by no means
true that awakening from sleep is invariably accompanied by a
dream; in considering the question it must be recollected that
it is complicated by the common experience of very rapid
forgetfulness of even a vivid and complicated dream, only the
fact of having dreamt remaining in the memory; it is clear
that amnesia may go so far that even the fact of dreaming may
be forgotten. On the whole, however, there appear to be no
good grounds for the assertion that we always dream when we
are asleep. On the other hand, there is no proof that partial
awakening is a necessary condition of dreaming.</p>

<p><i>Representative Dreams.</i>&mdash;Centrally initiated dreams may be due
to a kind of automatic excitation of the cerebral regions, especially
in the case of those clearly arising from the occupations or
sensations of the day or the hours immediately preceding the
dream. To the same cause we may attribute the recalling of
images apparently long since forgotten. Some of these revivals
of memory may be due to the fact that links of association which
are insufficient to restore an idea to consciousness in the waking
state may suffice to do so in sleep. Just as a good visualizer in
his waking moments may call up an object never clearly seen
and yet distinguish the parts, so in sleep, as L. F. A. Maury
(1817-1892) and others have shown, an image may be more
distinct in a dream than it was when originally presented (see
also below, Memory).</p>

<p><i>Presentative Dreams.</i>&mdash;The dreams due to real sensations, more
or less metamorphosed, may arise (a) from the states of the
internal organs, (b) from muscular states, (c) from subjective
sensations due to the circulation, &amp;c., or (d) from the ordinary
cause of the action of external stimuli on the organs of sense.</p>

<p>(a) The state of the stomach, heart, &amp;c., has long been recognized
as important in the causation of dreams (see below, <a>Classical
Views</a>). The common sensation of flying seems to be due in
many cases to the disturbance of these organs setting up sensations
resembling those felt in rapidly ascending or descending,
as in a swing or a lift. Indigestion is a frequent cause of nightmare&mdash;the
term given to oppressive and horrible dreams&mdash;and
bodily discomfort is sometimes translated into the moral region,
giving rise to the dream that a murder has been committed.
(b) Dreams of flying, &amp;c., have also been attributed to the
condition of the muscles during sleep; W. Wundt remarks that
the movements of the body, such as breathing, extensions of the
limbs and so on, must give rise to dream fancies; the awkward
position of the limbs may also excite images. (c) Especially
important, probably, for the dreams of the early part of the
night are the retinal conditions to which are due the <i>illusions
hypnagogiques</i> of the preliminary drowsy stage; but probably
Ladd goes too far in maintaining that entoptic stimuli, either
intra- or extra-organic in origin, condition all dreams. <i>Illusions
hypnagogiques</i>, termed popularly &ldquo;faces in the dark,&rdquo; of which
Maury has given a full account, are the not uncommon sensations
experienced, usually visual and seen with both open and closed
eyes, in the interval between retiring to rest and actually falling
asleep; they are comparable to the crystal-gazing visions of
waking moments; though mainly visual they may also affect
other senses. Besides the eye the ear may supply material for
dreams, when the circulation of the blood suggests rushing
waters or similar ideas. (d) It is a matter of common observation
that the temperature of the surface of the body determines in
many cases the character of the dreams, the real circumstances,
as might be expected from the general character of the
dream state, being exaggerated. In the same way the pressure
of bed-clothes, obstruction of the supply of air, &amp;c.,
may serve as the starting-point of dreams. The common dream
of being unclothed may perhaps be due to this cause, the
sensations associated with clothing being absent or so far
modified as to be unrecognizable. In the same way the absence
of foot-gear may account for some dreams of flying. It is
possible to test the influence of external stimuli by direct
experiment; Maury made a number of trials with the aid of an
assistant.</p>

<p><i>Rapidity of Dreams.</i>&mdash;It has often been asserted that we
dream with extreme rapidity; but this statement is by no
means borne out by experiment. In a trial recorded by J.
Clavière the beginning of the dream was accurately fixed by the
sounding of an alarm clock, which rang, then was silent for
22 seconds, and then began to ring continuously; the dream
scene was in a theatre, and he found by actual trial that the time
required in ordinary life for the performance of the scenes during
the interval of silence was about the same as in ordinary life.
Spontaneous dreams seem to show a different state of things;
it must be remembered that (1) dreams are commonly a succession
of images, the number of which cannot be legitimately
compared with the number of extra-organic stimuli which would
correspond to them in ordinary life; the real comparison is
with mental images; and (2) the rapidity of association varies
enormously in ordinary waking life. No proof, therefore, that
some dreams are slow can show that this mentation in others
is not extremely rapid. The most commonly quoted case is
one of Maury&rsquo;s; a bed-pole fell on his neck, and (so it is stated)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page560" id="page560"></a>560</span>
he dreamt of the French Revolution, the scenes culminating in
the fall of the guillotine on his neck; this has been held to show
that (1) dreams are extremely rapid; and (2) we construct a
dream story leading up to the external stimulus which is assumed
to have originated the dream. But Maury&rsquo;s dream was not
recorded till many years after it had occurred; there is nothing
to show that the dream, in this as in other similar cases, was not
in progress when the bed-pole fell, which thus by mere coincidence
would have intervened at the psychological moment; Maury&rsquo;s
memory on waking may have been to some extent hallucinatory.
But there are records of waking states, not necessarily abnormal,
in which time-perception is disturbed and brief incidents seem
interminably long; on the other hand, it appears from the
experiences of persons recovered from drowning that there is
great rapidity of ideation before the extinction of consciousness;
the same rapidity of thought has been observed in a fall from a
bicycle.</p>

<p><i>Reason in Dreams.</i>&mdash;Studies of dreams of normal individuals
based on large collections of instances are singularly few in
number; such as there are indicate great variations in the
source of dream thoughts and images, in the coherence of the
dream, and in the powers of memory. In ordinary life attention
dominates the images presented; in dreams heterogeneous and
disconnected elements are often combined; a resemblance need
not even have been consciously recognized for the mind to combine
two impressions in a dream; for example, an aching tooth
may (according to the dream) be extracted, and found to resemble
rocks on the sea-shore, which had not struck the waking mind
as in any way like teeth. Incongruence and incoherence are not,
however, a necessary characteristic of dreams, and individuals
are found whose dream ideas and scenes show a power of
reasoning and orderliness equal to that of a scene imagined or
experienced in ordinary life. In some cases the reasoning power
may attain a higher level than that of the ordinary conscious
life. In a well-authenticated case Professor Hilprecht was able
in a dream to solve a difficulty connected with two Babylonian
inscriptions, which had not previously been recognized as complementary
to each other; a point of peculiar interest is the
dramatic form in which the information came to him&mdash;an old
Babylonian priest appeared in his dream and gave him the clue
to the problem (see also below, Personality).</p>

<p><i>Memory in Dreams.</i>&mdash;Although prima facie the dream memory
is fragmentary and far less complete than the waking memory,
it is by no means uncommon to find a revival in sleep of early,
apparently quite forgotten, experiences: more striking is the
recollection in dreams of matters never supraliminally (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Subliminal Self</a></span>) apperceived at all.</p>

<p>The relation between the memory in dreams and in the
hypnotic trance is curious: suggestions given in the trance may
be accepted and then forgotten or never remembered in ordinary
life; this does not prevent them from reappearing occasionally
in dreams; conversely dreams forgotten in ordinary life may be
remembered in the hypnotic trance. These dream memories
of other states of consciousness suggest that dreams are sometimes
the product of a deeper stratum of the personality than
comes into play in ordinary waking life. It must be remembered
in this connexion that we judge of our dream consciousness by
our waking recollections, not directly, and our recollection of
our dreams is extraordinarily fragmentary; we do not know
how far our dream memory really extends. Connected with
memory of other states is the question of memory in dreams of
previous dream states; occasionally a separate chain of memory,
analogous to a secondary personality, seems to be formed. We
may be also conscious that we have been dreaming, and subsequently,
without intermediate waking, relate as a dream the
dream previously experienced. In spite of the irrationality of
dreams in general, it by no means follows that the earlier and
later portions of a dream do not cohere; we may interpolate an
episode and again take up the first motive, exactly as happens
in real life. The strength of the dream memory is shown by the
recurrence of images in dreams; a picture, the page of a book,
or other image may be reproduced before our eyes several times
in the course of a dream without the slightest alteration, although
the waking consciousness would be quite incapable of such a feat
of visualizing. In this connexion may be mentioned the phenomenon
of redreaming; the same dream may recur either on
the same or on different nights; this seems to be in many cases
pathological or due to drugs, but may also occur under normal
conditions.</p>

<p><i>Personality.</i>&mdash;As a rule the personality of the dreamer is
unchanged; but it also happens that the confusion of identity
observed with regard to other objects embraces the dreamer
himself; he imagines himself to be some one else; he is alternately
actor and observer; he may see himself playing a part
or may divest himself of his body and wander incorporeally.
Ordinary dreams, however, do not go beyond a splitting of
personality; we hold conversations, and are intensely surprised
at the utterances of a dream figure, which, however, is merely
an <i>alter ego</i>. As in the case of Hilprecht (see above) the information
given by another part of the personality may not only
appear but actually be novel.</p>

<p><i>Supernormal Dreams.</i>&mdash;In addition to dreams in which there
is a revival of memory or a rise into consciousness of facts
previously only subliminally cognized, a certain number of dreams
are on record in which telepathy (<i>q.v.</i>) seems to play a part;
much of the evidence is, however, discounted by the possibility
of hallucinatory memory. Another class of dreams (prodromic)
is that in which the abnormal bodily states of the dreamer are
brought to his knowledge in sleep, sometimes in a symbolical
form; thus a dream of battle or sanguinary conflict may presage
a haemorrhage. The increased power of suggestion which is
the normal accompaniment of the hypnotic trance may make
its appearance in dreams, and exercise either a curative influence
or act capriciously in producing hysteria and the tropic changes
known as &ldquo;stigmata.&rdquo; We may meet with various forms of
hyperaesthesia in dreams; quite apart from the recovery of
sight by those who have lost it wholly or in part (see below,
Dreams of the Blind), we find that the powers of the senses may
undergo an intensification, and, <i>e.g.</i>, the power of appreciating
music be enormously enhanced in persons usually indifferent to
it. Mention must also be made of the experience of R. L.
Stevenson, who tells in <i>Across the Plains</i> how by self-suggestion
he was able to secure from his dreams the motives of some of his
best romances.</p>

<p><i>Voluntary Action in Dreams.</i>&mdash;Connected with dreams voluntarily
influenced is the question of how far dreams once initiated
are modifiable at the will of the dreamer. Some few observers,
like F. W. H. Myers and Dr F. van Eeden, record that they can
at longer or shorter intervals control their actions in their
dreams, though usually to a less extent than their imagined
actions in waking life. Dr van Eeden, for example, tells us that
he has what he calls a &ldquo;clear dream&rdquo; once a month and is able
to predetermine what he will do when he becomes aware that
he is dreaming.</p>

<p><i>Dreams of Children.</i>&mdash;Opinions differ widely as to the age at
which children begin to dream; G. Compayré maintains that
dreaming has been observed in the fourth month, but reflex
action is always a possible explanation of the observed facts.
S. de Sanctis found that in boys of eleven only one out of eight
said that he dreamt seldom, as against four out of seven at the
age of six; but we cannot exclude the possibility that dreams
were frequent but forgotten. If correct, the observation suggests
that dreams appear comparatively late. Individual cases of
dreaming, or possibly of waking hallucination, are known as
early as the age of two and a half years; according to de Sanctis
dreams occur before the fifth year, but are seldom remembered;
as a rule the conscious dream age begins with the fourth year;
speech or movement, however, in earlier years, though they may
be attributed to reflex action, are more probably due to dreams.</p>

<p><i>Dreams of the Old.</i>&mdash;In normal individuals above the age of
sixty-five de Sanctis found dreams were rare; atmospheric
influences seem to be important elements in causing them;
memory of them is weak; they are emotionally poor, and deal
with long past scenes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page561" id="page561"></a>561</span></p>

<p><i>Dreams of Adults.</i>&mdash;Any attempt to record or influence our
dreams may be complicated by (a) direct suggestion, leading to
the production of the phenomena for which we are looking, and
(b) indirect suggestion leading to the more lively recollection of
dreams in general and of certain dreams in particular. Consequently
it cannot be assumed that the facts thus ascertained
represent the normal conditions. According to F. Heerwagen&rsquo;s
statistics women sleep more lightly and dream more than men;
the frequency of dreams is proportional to their vividness;
women who dream sleep longer than those who do not; dreams
tend to become less frequent with advancing age. The total
number of remembered dreams varies considerably with different
observers, some attaining an average of ten per night. The
senses mainly active in dreams are, according to one set of
experiments, vision in 60%, hearing in 5%, taste in 3%, and
smell in 1.5%, where the dreamers had looked at coloured
papers before falling asleep; when taste or smell had been
stimulated, the visual dreams fell to about 50%, and the sense
stimulated was active twice as often as it would otherwise be;
dreams in which motion was a prominent feature were 10% of
the former class, 14% and 18% of the two latter. Experiments
by J. Mourly Vold show even more distinctly the influence of
suggestion both as to the form, visual or otherwise, and the
content (colours and forms of objects) of dreams. According to
most observers dreams are most vivid and frequent between the
ages of 20 and 25, but H. Maudsley puts the maximum between
30 and 35. De Sanctis got replies from 165 men and 55 women:
the proportion between the sexes closely agrees with the results
attained by Heerwagen and M. W. Calkins; 13% of men and
33% of women said they always dreamt, 27% and 45% often,
50% and 13% rarely, and the remainder (precisely the same
percentage for men and women&mdash;9.09) either did not dream or
did not remember that they dreamt. Nearly twice as many
women as men had vivid dreams; in the matter of complication
of the dream experiences the sexes are about equal; daily life
supplies more material in the dreams of men; nearly twice as
many women as men remember their dreams clearly, a fact
which hangs together to some extent with the vividness of the
dreams, though it by no means follows that a vivid dream is well
remembered. There are great variations in the emotional
character of dreams; some observers report twice as many
unpleasant dreams as the reverse; in other cases the emotions
seem to be absent; others again have none but pleasing dreams.
Individual experience also varies very largely as to the time
when most dreams are experienced; in some cases the great
majority are subsequent to 6.30 A.M.; others find that quite half
occur before 4.0 A.M.</p>

<p><i>Dreams of the Neuropathic, Insane, Idiots, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Much attention
has been given to the dreams of hysterical subjects. It appears
that their dreams are specially liable to exercise an influence over
their waking life, perhaps because they do not distinguish them,
any more than their waking hallucinations, from reality. P.
Janet maintains that the cause of hysteria may be sought in a
dream. The dreams of the hysterical have a tendency to recur.
Epileptic subjects dream less than the hysterical, and their dreams
are seldom of a terrifying nature; certain dreams seem to take the
place of an epileptic attack. Dreaming seems to be rare in
idiots. De Sanctis divides paranoiacs into three classes: (a)
those with systematized delusions, (b) those with frequent
hallucinations, and (c) degenerates;&mdash;the dreams of the first
class resemble their delusions; the second class is distinguished
by the complexity of its dreams; the third by their vividness, by
their delusions of megalomania, and by their influence on daily
life. Alcoholic subjects have vivid and terrifying dreams,
characterized by the frequent appearance of animals in them, and
delirium tremens may originate during sleep.</p>

<p><i>Dreams of the Blind, Deaf, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;As regards visual dreams the
blind fall into three classes&mdash;(1) those who are blind from birth or
become blind before the age of five; (2) those who become blind
at the &ldquo;critical age&rdquo; from five to seven; (3) those who become
blind after the age of seven. The dreams of the first class are
non-visual; but in the dreams of Helen Keller there are traces of
a visual content; the second class sometimes has visual dreams;
the third class does not differ from normal persons, though visual
dreams may fade away after many years of blindness. In the
case of the partially blind the clearness of vision in a dream
exceeds that of normal life when the partial loss of sight occurred
in the sixth or later years. The education of Helen Keller is
interesting from another point of view; after losing the senses of
sight and hearing in infancy she began her education at seven
years and was able to articulate at eleven; it is recorded
that she &ldquo;talked&rdquo; in her dreams soon after. This accords
with the experience of normal individuals who acquire a foreign
language. Her extraordinary memory enables her to recall
faintly some traces of the sunlit period of her life, but they
hardly affect her dreams, so far as can be judged. The dreams of
the blind, according to the records of F. Hitschmann, present
some peculiarities; animals as well as man speak; toothache and
bodily pains are perceived as such; impersonal dreaming,
taking the form of a drama or reading aloud, is found; and he
had a strong tendency to reproduce or create verse.</p>

<p><i>Dreams of Animals.</i>&mdash;We are naturally reduced to inference in
dealing with animals as with very young children; but various
observations seem to show that dreams are common in older dogs,
especially after hunting expeditions; in young dogs sleep seems to
be quieter; dogs accustomed to the chase seem to dream more
than other kinds.</p>

<p><i>Dreams among the Non-European Peoples.</i>&mdash;In the lower
stages of culture the dream is regarded as no less real and its
personages as no less objective than those of the ordinary waking
life; this is due in the main to the habit of mind of such peoples
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Animism</a></span>), but possibly in some measure also to the occurrence
of veridical dreams (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Telepathy</a></span>). In either case the savage
explanation is animistic, and animism is commonly assumed to
have been developed very largely as a result of theorising
dreams. Two explanations of a dream are found among the
lower races: (1) that the soul of the dreamer goes out, and visits
his friends, living or dead, his old haunts or unfamiliar scenes and
so on; or (2) that the souls of the dead and others come to visit
him, either of their own motion or at divine command. In
either of the latter cases or at a higher stage of culture when the
dream is regarded as god-sent, though no longer explained in
terms of animism, it is often regarded as oracular (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Oracle</a></span>),
the explanation being sometimes symbolical, sometimes simple.</p>

<p>There are two classes of dreams which have a special importance
in the lower cultures: (1) the dream or vision of the initiation
fast; and (2) the dream caused by the process known as
incubation, which is often analogous to the initiation fast. In
many parts of North America the individual Indian acquires a
tutelary spirit, known as <i>manito</i> or <i>nagual</i>, by his initiation
dream or vision; the idea being perhaps that the spirit by the act
of appearing shows its subjection to the will of the man.
Similarly, the magician acquires his familiar in North America,
Australia and elsewhere by dreaming of an animal. Incubation
consists in retiring to sleep in a temple, sometimes on the top of a
mountain or other unusual spot, in order to obtain a revelation
through a dream. Fasting, continence and other observances
are frequently prescribed as preliminaries. Certain classes of
dreams have, especially in the middle ages, been attributed to the
influence of evil spirits (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Demonology</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Classical and Medieval Views of Dreams.</i>&mdash;Side by side with the
prevalent animistic view of dreams we find in antiquity and
among the semi-civilized attempts at philosophical or physiological
explanations of dreams. Democritus, from whom the
Epicureans derived their theory, held the cause of them to be
the simulacra or phantasms of corporeal objects which are
constantly floating about the atmosphere and attack the soul
in sleep&mdash;a view hardly distinguishable from animism. Aristotle,
however, refers them to the impressions left by objects seen with
the eyes of the body; he further remarks on the exaggeration
of slight stimuli when they are incorporated into a dream; a
small sound becomes a noise like thunder. Plato, too, connects
dreaming with the normal waking operations of the mind;
Pliny, on the other hand, admits this only for dreams which take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page562" id="page562"></a>562</span>
place after meals, the remainder being supernatural. Cicero,
however, takes the view that they are simply natural occurrences
no more and no less than the mental operations and sensations
of the waking state. The pathological side of dreams attracted
the notice of physicians. Hippocrates was disposed to admit
that some dreams might be divine, but held that others were
premonitory of diseased states of the body. Galen took the same
view in some of his speculations.</p>

<p>Symbolical interpretations are combined with pathological
no less than animistic interpretations of dreams; they are
also extremely common among the lower classes in Europe at
the present day, but in this case no consistent explanation of
their importance for the divination of future events is usually
discoverable. Among the Greeks Plato in the <i>Timaeus</i> (ch. xlvi,
xlvii) explains dreams as prophetic visions received by the lower
appetitive soul through the liver; their interpretation requires
intelligence. The Stoics seem to have held that dreams may be
a divine revelation and more than one volume on the interpretation
of dreams has come down to us, the most important being
perhaps the <span class="grk" title="Oneirokritika">&#908;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#940;</span> of Daldianus Artemidorus. We find
parallels to this in a Mussulman work by Gabdorrachaman,
translated by Pierre Vattier under the name of <i>Onirocrite
mussulman</i>, and in the numerous books on the interpretation of
dreams which circulate at the present day. In Siam dream books
are found (<i>Intern. Archiv für Anthr.</i> viii 150); one of the
functions of the Australian medicine man is to decide how a
dream is to be interpreted.</p>

<p><i>Modern Views.</i>&mdash;The doctrine of Descartes that existence
depended upon thought naturally led his followers to maintain
that the mind is always thinking and consequently that dreaming
is continuous. Locke replied to this that men are not always
conscious of dreaming, and it is hard to be conceived that the
soul of the sleeping man should this moment be thinking, while
the soul of the waking man cannot recollect in the next moment
a jot of all those thoughts. That we always dream was maintained
by Leibnitz, Kant, Sir W. Hamilton and others; the
latter refutes the argument of Locke by the just observation
that the somnambulist has certainly been conscious, but fails
to recall the fact when he returns to the normal state.</p>

<p>It has been commonly held by metaphysicians that the nature
of dreams is explained by the suspension of volition during
sleep; Dugald Stewart asserts that it is not wholly dormant
but loses its hold on the faculties, and he thus accounts for the
incoherence of dreams and the apparent reality of dream images.</p>

<p>Cudworth, from the orderly sequence of dream combinations
and their novelty, argues that the state arises, not from any
&ldquo;fortuitous dancings of the spirits,&rdquo; but from the &ldquo;phantastical
power of the soul.&rdquo; According to K. A. Scherner, dreaming
is a decentralization of the movement of life; the ego becomes
purely receptive and is merely the point around which the
peripheral life plays in perfect freedom. Hobbes held that
dreams all proceed from the agitation of the inward parts of a
man&rsquo;s body, which, owing to their connexion with the brain,
serve to keep the latter in motion. For Schopenhauer the cause
of dreams is the stimulation of the brain by the internal regions
of the organism through the sympathetic nervous system.
These impressions the mind afterwards works up into quasi-realities
by means of its forms of space, time, causality, &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DREDGE<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> <span class="sc">and</span> <b>DREDGING.</b> The word &ldquo;dredge&rdquo; is used
in two senses. (1) From Mid. Eng. <i>dragie</i>, through Fr. <i>dragée</i>,
from Gr. <span class="grk" title="tragêmata">&#964;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>, sweetmeats, it means a confection of sugar
formed with seeds, bits of spice or medicinal agents. The word
in this sense is obsolete, but survives in &ldquo;dredger,&rdquo; a box with a
perforated top used for sprinkling such a sugar-mixture, flour
or other powdered substance. &ldquo;Dredge&rdquo; is also a local term
for a mixed crop of oats and barley sown together (&ldquo;maslin&rdquo;
or &ldquo;meslin,&rdquo; cf. Fr. <i>dragée</i>), and in mining is applied to ore
of a mixed value. (2) Connected with &ldquo;drag,&rdquo; or at least derived
from the same root, dredge or dredger is a mechanical appliance
for collecting together and drawing to the surface (&ldquo;dredging&rdquo;)
objects and material from the beds of rivers or the bottom of the
sea. In the following account the operations of dredging in this
sense are discussed (1) as involved in hydraulic engineering, (2)
in connexion with the work of the naturalist in marine biology.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">1. Hydraulic Engineering</p>

<p>Dredging is the name given by engineers to the process of
excavating materials under water, raising them to the surface
and depositing them in barges, or delivering them through a
shoot, a longitudinal conveyor, or pipes, to the place where it is
desired to deposit them. It has long been useful in works of
marine and hydraulic engineering, and has been brought in
modern times to a state of high perfection.</p>

<p>The employment of dredging plant and the selection of special
appliances to be used in different localities and in varying
circumstances require the exercise of sound judgment on the
part of the engineer. In rivers and estuaries where the bottom
is composed of light soils, and where the scour of the tide can be
governed by training walls and other works constructed at
reasonable expense, so as to keep the channel clear without
dredging, it is manifest that dredging machinery with its large
cost for working expenses and for annual upkeep should be as
far as possible avoided. On the other hand, where the bottom
consists of clay, rock or other hard substances, dredging must,
in the first instance at any rate, be employed to deepen and
widen the channel which it is sought to improve. In some
instances, such as the river Mississippi, a deep channel has for
many years been maintained by jetties, with occasional resort
to dredging to preserve the required channel section and to
hasten its enlargement. The bar of the river Mersey is 11 m.
from land, and the cost of training works would be so great as to
forbid their construction; but, by a capital expenditure of
£120,000 and an annual expense of £20,000 for three years, the
depth of water over the bar at low tide has been increased by
dredging from 11 ft. to 27 ft., the channel being 1500 ft. wide.</p>

<p><i>&rdquo;Bag and Spoon&rdquo; Dredger.</i>&mdash;The first employment of
machinery for dredging is, like the discovery of the canal lock,
claimed by Holland and Italy, in both of which countries it is
believed to have been in use before it was introduced into
Britain. The Dutch, at an early period, used what is termed
the &ldquo;bag and spoon&rdquo; dredger for cleansing their canals. The
&ldquo;spoon&rdquo; consisted of a ring of iron about 2 ft. in diameter
flattened and steeled for about a third of its circumference and
having a bag of strong leather attached to it by leathern thongs.
The ring and bag were fixed to a pole which was lowered to the
bottom from the side of a barge moored in the canal or river.
The &ldquo;spoon&rdquo; was then dragged along the bottom by a rope
made fast to the iron ring actuated by a windlass placed at the
other end of the barge, the pole being prevented from rising by a
hitched rope which caused the &ldquo;spoon&rdquo; to penetrate the bottom
and fill the bag. When the &ldquo;spoon&rdquo; reached the end of the barge
where the windlass was placed, the winding was still continued,
and the suspended rope being nearly perpendicular the &ldquo;bag&rdquo;
was raised to the gunwale of the barge and the excavated
material emptied into the barge. The &ldquo;bag&rdquo; was then hauled
back to the opposite end to be lowered for another supply. This
system is still in use, but is only adaptable to a limited depth of
water and a soft bottom; it has been largely used in canals and
frequently in the Thames. At the Fosdyke Canal in Lincolnshire
135,000 tons were raised in the manner described. According
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page563" id="page563"></a>563</span>
to J. J. Webster (<i>Proc. Inst. C. E.</i> vol. 89), the first application
of steam power for dredging operations was to a &ldquo;spoon
&amp; bag&rdquo; dredger for cleansing Sunderland harbour, the engine
being made by Messrs Boulton &amp; Watt of Soho, Birmingham.</p>

<p><i>Dredging by Bucket between Two Lighters.</i>&mdash;Another plan of
dredging, practised at an early period in rivers of considerable
breadth, was to moor two barges, one on each side of the river.
Between them was slung an iron dredging bucket, which was
attached to both barges by chains wound on the barrels of a
crab winch worked by six men in one barge and round a simple
windlass worked by two men in the other barge. The bucket,
being lowered at the side of the barge carrying the windlass,
was drawn across the bottom of the river by the crab winch on
the other barge; and having been raised and emptied, it was
hauled across by the opposite windlass for repetition of the
process. This process was in use in the River Tay until 1833.</p>

<p><i>Bucket Ladder Dredgers.</i>&mdash;The earliest record of a bucket
ladder dredger is contained in the first paper of the first volume
(1836) of the <i>Transactions</i> of the Institution of Civil Engineers.
This machine was brought into use at the Hull Docks about
1782. The bucket chain was driven by two horses working a
horse-gear on the deck of the vessel. The buckets were constructed
of <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. bars of iron spaced <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. apart, and were 4 ft.
long, 13 in. deep, 12 in. wide at the mouth and about 6 in. wide
at the bottom. This dredger raised about 30 tons per hour at the
cost of 2½d. per ton, which covered the wages of three men working
the dredger, eight men working the lighters and the keep of three
horses. A dredger of this kind and power would only work in
ballast, mud or other soft material, but the machine was gradually
improved and increased in capacity and power by different
manufacturers until it became a very efficient machine in skilful
hands, excavating and raising material from depths of 5 ft. to
60 ft. of water at a cost not very different from, and in many
cases less than, that at which the same work could be performed
on land. With the powerful dredgers now constructed, almost
all materials, except solid rock or very large boulders, can be
dredged with ease. Loose gravel is perhaps the most favourable
material to work in, but a powerful dredger will readily break up
and raise indurated beds of gravel, clay and boulders, and has
even found its way through the surface of soft rock, though it
will not penetrate very far into it. In some cases steel diggers
alternating with the buckets on the bucket frame have been
successfully employed. The construction of large steam dredgers
is now carried on by many engineering firms. The main feature
of the machine is the bucket ladder which is hung at the top end
by eye straps to the frame of the vessel, and at the lower end by
a chain reived in purchase blocks and connected to the hoisting
gear, so that the ladder may be raised and lowered to suit the
varying depths of water in which the dredger works. The upper
tumbler for working the bucket chain is generally square or
pentagonal in form and made of steel with loose steel wearing
pieces securely bolted to it. The tumbler is securely keyed to
the steel shaft which is connected by gearing and shafting to
the steam engine, a friction block being inserted at a convenient
point to prevent breakage should any hidden obstacle causing
unusual strain be met with in the path of the buckets. The
lower tumbler is similar in construction to the upper tumbler,
but is usually pentagonal or hexagonal in shape. The buckets
are generally made with steel backs to which the plating of the
buckets is riveted; the cutting edge of the buckets consists of a
strong steel bar suitably shaped and riveted to the body. The
intermediate links are made of hammered iron or steel with
removable steel bushes to take the wear of the connecting pins,
which are also of steel. The hoisting gear may be driven either
from the main engine by frictional gearing or by an independent
set of engines. Six anchors and chains worked by powerful steam
crabs are provided for regulating the position of the dredger in
regard to its work.</p>

<p><i>Barge-loading Dredgers</i> used formerly to be provided with two
ladders, one on each side of the vessel, or contained in wells
formed in the vessel near each side. Two ladders were adopted,
partly to permit the dredger to excavate the material close to a
quay or wall, and partly to enable one ladder to work while the
other was being repaired. Bucket ladder dredgers are now,
however, generally constructed with one central ladder working
in a well; frequently the bucket ladder projects at either the
head or stern of the vessel, to enable it to cut its own way through
a shoal or bank, a construction which has been found very useful.
In one modification of this method the bucket ladder is supported
upon a traversing frame which slides along the fixed framing of
the dredger and moves the bucket ladder forward as soon as it
has been sufficiently lowered to clear the end of the well. In
places where a large quantity of dredging has to be done, a
stationary dredger with three or four large hopper barges proves
generally to be the most economical kind of plant. It has,
however, the disadvantage of requiring large capital expenditure,
while the dredger and its attendant barges take up an amount
of space which is sometimes inconvenient where traffic is large
and the navigable width narrow. The principal improvements
made in barge-loading dredgers have been the increase in the
size of the buckets and the strength of the dredging gear, the
application of more economical engines for working the machinery,
and the use of frictional gearing for driving the ladder-hoisting
gear. It is very important that the main drive be fitted with
the friction blocks or clutches before alluded to.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Up to the year 1877 dredgers were seldom made with buckets
of a capacity exceeding 9 cub. ft., but since that time they have been
gradually increased in capacity. In the dredger &ldquo;Melbourne,&rdquo;
constructed by Messrs William Simons &amp; Co. to the design and
specification of Messrs Coode, Son &amp; Matthews, about the year 1886,
the buckets had a capacity of 22 cub. ft., the dredger being capable
of making 37 ft. of water. The driving power consists of two pairs of
surface-condensing engines, each of 250 i.h.p., having cylinders 20 in.
and 40 in. in diameter respectively, with a 30 in. stroke, the boiler
pressure being 90 &#8468; per sq. in. The vessel is 200 ft. long by 36 ft.
wide and 11 ft. 6 in. deep, and is driven by twin screw propellers.
The gearing is arranged so that either pair of engines can be employed
for dredging. The speed under steam is 7 knots, and in free-getting
material 800 tons per hour can be dredged with ease. On
one occasion the dredger loaded 400 tons in 20 minutes. The speed
of the bucket chain is 83 lineal ft. per minute. The draught of the
dredger in working trim is 7 ft. forward and 9 ft. aft. The efficiency
of the machine, or the net work in raising materials compared with
the power exerted in the cylinders, is about 25%. The dredged
material is delivered into barges moored alongside. Contrasting
favourably with former experience, the &ldquo;Melbourne&rdquo; worked for
the first six months without a single breakage. She is fitted with
very powerful mooring winches, a detail which is of great importance
to ensure efficiency in working.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;St Austell&rdquo; (Plate I. fig. 3), a powerful barge-loading
dredger 195 ft. long by 35 ft. 6 in. beam by 13 ft. deep, fitted with
twin-screw compound surface-condensing propelling engines of
1000 i.h.p., either set of engines being available for dredging, was
constructed for H.M. Dockyard, Devonport, by Messrs Wm. Simons
&amp; Co. in 1896. This dredger loaded thirty-five 500-ton hopper
barges in the week ending April 2, 1898, dredging 17,500 tons of
material in the working time of 29 hours 5 minutes.</p>

<p>An instance of a still larger and more powerful dredger is the
&ldquo;Develant,&rdquo; constructed by Messrs Wm. Simons &amp; Co., for Nicolaiev,
South Russia. She is a bow-well, barge-loading, bucket ladder
dredger, with a length of 186 ft., a breadth, moulded, of 36 ft., and a
depth, moulded, of 13 ft. The bucket ladder is of sufficient length
to dredge 36 ft. below the water level. The buckets are exceptionally
large, each having a capacity of 36 cub. ft., or fully two tons weight of
material, giving a lifting capacity of 1890 tons per hour. At the
dredging trials 2000 tons of spoil were lifted in one hour with an
expenditure of 250 i.h.p. The propelling power is supplied by one
pair of compound surface-condensing marine engines of 850 i.h.p.,
having two cylindrical boilers constructed for a working pressure
of 120 &#8468; per sq. in. Each boiler is capable of supplying steam to
either the propelling or dredging machinery, thus allowing the vessel
to always have a boiler in reserve. On the trials a speed of 8½ knots
was obtained. The bucket ladder, which weighs over 100 tons, exclusive
of dredgings, is raised and lowered by a set of independent
engines. For man&oelig;uvring, powerful winches driven by independent
engines are placed at the bow and stern. The vessel is fitted
throughout with electric light, arc lamps being provided above the
deck to enable dredging to be carried on at night. Steam steering
gear, a repairing shop, a three-ton crane, and all the latest appliances
are installed on board.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Dérocheuse&rdquo; (Plate II. fig. 12), constructed by Messrs
Lobnitz &amp; Co., is a good example of the dredger fitted with their
patent rock cutters, as used on the Suez Canal. These rock cutters
consist of stamps passing down through the bottom of the dredger,
slightly in advance of the bucket chain, and are employed for breaking
up rock in front of the bucket ladder so that it may be raised by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page564" id="page564"></a>564</span>
buckets afterwards. This system of subaqueous rock cutting plant, on
Messrs Lobnitz&rsquo;s patent system, was effectively employed in deepening
the Manchester Ship Canal, and removed a considerable length
of rock, increasing the depth of water from 26 ft. to 28 ft. at a cost
of about 9d. per cub. yd. A full and illustrated description of this
plant, and of a similar plant supplied to the Argentine Government,
was published in <i>Engineering</i> of August 17, 1906. An illustration
of a bucket of 54 cub. ft. capacity constructed by Messrs Lobnitz
&amp; Co. is given (Plate II fig. 11), from which some idea of the size
of dredging machinery as developed in recent practice may be obtained.
In regard to the depth of water that can be obtained by
dredging, it is interesting to note that the dredger &ldquo;Diver,&rdquo; constructed
by Messrs. Hunter &amp; English for Mr Samuel Williams of
London, is capable of working in 60 ft. of water. In this vessel an
ingenious arrangement was devised by Mr Williams, by which part
of the weight of the dredger was balanced while the ladder itself
could be drawn up through the bucket well and placed upon the
deck, enabling a long ladder to be used for a comparatively short
vessel. The &ldquo;Tilbury&rdquo; dredger, also constructed by Messrs Hunter
&amp; English, was able to dredge to a depth of 45 ft. below the surface
of the water.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Hopper Barges.</i>&mdash;To receive the materials excavated by barge-loading
dredgers, steam hopper barges are now generally
employed, capable of carrying 500 tons or more of excavation
and of steaming loaded at a speed of about 9 m. per hour. These
hopper barges are made with hinged flaps in their bottoms,
which can be opened when the place of deposit is reached and
the dredgings easily and quickly discharged.</p>

<p>Good examples of these vessels are the two steam hopper barges
built for the Conservators of the river Thames in 1898. The
dimensions are: length 190 ft., breadth 30 ft., depth 13 ft.
3 in., hopper capacity 900 tons. They are propelled by a set of
triple expansion engines of 1200 i.h.p., with two return-tube
boilers having a working pressure of 160 &#8468;. Special appliances
are provided to work the hopper doors by steam power from
independent engines placed at the forward end of the hopper.
A steam windlass is fixed forward and a steam capstan aft. The
vessels are fitted with cabins for the officers and crew. On
their trial trip, the hoppers having their full load, a speed of
11 knots was obtained, the coal consumption being 1.44 &#8468;
per i.h.p.</p>

<p><i>Methods of Dredging.</i>&mdash;In river dredging two systems are
pursued. One plan consists in excavating a series of longitudinal
furrows parallel to the axis of the stream; the other in dredging
cross furrows from side to side of the river. It is found that
inequalities are left between the longitudinal furrows when that
system is practised, which do not occur, to the same extent, in
side or cross dredging; and cross dredging leaves a more uniform
bottom. In either case the dredger is moored from the head
and stern by chains about 250 fathoms in length. These chains
in improved dredgers are wound round windlasses worked by
the engine, so that the vessel can be moved ahead or astern by
simply throwing them into or out of gear. In longitudinal
dredging the vessel is worked forward by the head chain, while
the buckets are at the same time performing the excavation, so
that a longitudinal trench is made in the bottom of the river.
After proceeding a certain length, the dredger is stopped and
permitted to drop down and commence a new longitudinal
furrow, parallel to the first one. In cross dredging, on the other
hand, the vessel is supplied with four additional moorings, two
on each side, and these chains are, like the head and stern chains,
wound round barrels worked by steam power. In cross dredging
we may suppose the vessel to be moored at one side of the
channel to be excavated. The bucket frame is set in motion,
but instead of the dredger being drawn forward by the head chain,
she is drawn across the river by the starboard chains, and, having
reached the extent of her work in that direction, she is then
drawn a few feet forward by the head chain, and the bucket
frame being still in motion the vessel is hauled across by the
port chains to the side whence she started. By means of this
transverse motion of the dredger a series of cross cuts is made;
the dredger takes out the whole excavation from side to side
to a uniform depth and leaves no protuberances such as are
found to exist between the furrows in longitudinal dredging,
even when it is executed with great care. The two systems
will be understood by reference to fig. 1, where A and B are the
head and stern moorings, and C, D, E and F the side moorings.
The arc e f represents the course of the vessel in cross dredging;
while in longitudinal dredging, as already explained, she is
drawn forward towards A, and again dropped down to commence
a new longitudinal furrow.</p>

<p><i>Hopper Dredgers.</i>&mdash;In places where barge-loading dredgers
are inconvenient, owing to confined space and interference with
navigation, and where it is necessary to curtail capital expenditure,
hopper dredgers are convenient and economical. These
dredgers were first constructed by Messrs. Wm. Simons &amp; Co.
of Renfrew, who patented and constructed what they call the
&ldquo;Hopper Dredger,&rdquo; combining in itself the advantages of a
dredger for raising material and a scow hopper vessel for conveying
it to the place of discharge, both of which services are
performed by the same engines and the same crew.</p>

<p>The vessel for this type of dredger is made of sufficient length
and floating capacity to contain its own dredgings, which it
carries out to the depositing ground as soon as its hopper is full.
Considerable time is of course occupied in slipping and recovering
moorings, and conveying material to the depositing ground,
but these disadvantages are in many instances counterbalanced
by the fact that less capital is required for plant and that less
room is taken up by the dredger. If the depositing ground is
far away, the time available for dredging is much curtailed,
but the four-screw hopper dredger constructed by Messrs Wm.
Simons &amp; Co. for Bristol has done good work at the cost of
5d. per ton, including wages, repairs, coals, grease, sundries and
interest on the first cost of the plant, notwithstanding that the
material has to be taken 10 m. from the Bristol Dock. She can
lift 400 tons of stiff clay per hour from a depth of 36 ft. below
the water line, and the power required varies from 120 i.h.p.
to 150 i.h.p., according to the nature of the material. The
speed is 9 knots, and 4 propellers are provided, two at the head
and two at the stern, to enable the vessel to steam equally well
either way, as the river Avon is too narrow to permit her to be
turned round.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The hopper dredger &ldquo;La Puissante&rdquo; (Plate I. fig. 4), constructed
by Messrs Wm. Simons &amp; Co. for the Suez Canal Co. for the improvement
of Port Said Roads, is a fine example of this class of dredger.
She is 275 ft. long by 47 ft. beam by 19 ft. deep. The hopper capacity
is 2000 tons, and the draught loaded 16 ft. 5 in. The maximum
dredging depth is 40 ft., and the minimum dredging depth is only
limited by the vessel&rsquo;s draught, she being able to cut her own way.
The bucket ladder works through the well in the stern and weighs with
buckets 120 tons. The buckets have each a capacity of 30 cub. ft.
and raised on trial 1600 tons per hour. The dredger is propelled by
two sets of independent triple expansion surface-condensing engines
of 1800 i.h.p. combined, working with steam at 160 &#8468; pressure,
supplied by two mild steel multitubular boilers. Each set of engines
is capable of driving the buckets independently at speeds of 16 and
20 buckets per minute. The bucket ladder is fitted with buffer
springs at its upper end to lessen the shock when working in a seaway.
The dredger can deliver the dredged material either into its
own hopper or into barges lying on either side. The vessel obtained
a speed of 9¾ knots per hour on trial. The coal consumption during
6 hours&rsquo; steaming trial was 1.66 &#8468; per i.h.p. hour. Fig. 9 (Plate I.)
shows a still larger hopper dredger by the same constructors.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Dredgers fitted with Long Shoot or Shore Delivering Apparatus.</i>&mdash;The
first instance of dredgers being fitted with long shoots was
in the Suez Canal. The soil in the lakes was very variable, the
surface being generally loose mud which lay in some places in
the sand, but frequently more or less on hard clay. Resort was
had to shoots 230 ft. long, supported on pontoons connected
with the hull of the dredger. The sand flowed away with a
moderate supply of water to the shoots when they were fixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page565" id="page565"></a>565</span>
at an inclination of about 1 in 20, but when the sand was mixed
with shells these formed a coating which prevented the stream
of water from washing out the shoot, and even with an inclination
of 1 in 10 material could not be delivered. A pair of endless
chains working down the long shoot overcame the difficulty,
and also enabled hard clay in lumps to be dealt with. One
dredger turned out about 2000 cub. yds. of thick clay in 15 hours,
and when the clay was not hard it could deliver 150,000 cub. yds.
in a month for several consecutive months.</p>

<p>Shore delivery has been successfully effected by raising the
material by buckets in the ordinary way and delivering it into
a vertical cylinder connected with floating jointed pipes through
which the dredgings pass to the shore. This, of course, can only
be done where the place of deposit is near the spot where the
material is dredged. Two plans have been satisfactorily employed
for this operation. At the Amsterdam Canal the stuff was
discharged from the buckets into a vertical cylinder, and after
being mingled with water by a revolving Woodford pump was
sent off under a head of pressure of 4 or 5 ft. to the place of
deposit in a semi-fluid state through pipes made of timber,
hooped with iron. These wooden pipes were made in lengths
of about 15 ft., connected with leather joints, and floated on the
surface of the water. A somewhat similar process was also
employed on the Suez Canal.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A dredger (Plate I. fig. 5), constructed by Messrs Hunter &amp; English
for reclamation works on Lake Copais in Greece was fitted with delivery
belts running on rollers in steel lattice frames on each side of
the vessel supported by masts and ropes. It could deliver 100 cub.
metres per hour at 85 ft. from the centre of the dredger, at a cost of
1.82d. per cub. metre for working expenses, with coal at 45s. per ton,
including 0.66d. per cub. metre for renewal of belts, upon which the
wear and tear was heavy.</p>

<p>Another instance of the successful application of shore delivery
apparatus is that of a dredger for Lake Titicaca, Peru, constructed
by Messrs Hunter &amp; English, which was fitted with long shoots on
both sides, conveying the dredged material about 100 ft. from the
centre of the dredger upon either side. The shoots were supported
by shear-legs and ropes, and were supplied with water from a centrifugal
pump in the engine room. This dredger could excavate and
deliver 120 cub. yds. per hour at a cost of 1.725d. per cub. yd. with coal
costing 40s. per ton. If coal had been available at the ordinary rate
in England of 20s. per ton, the cost of the dredging and delivery
would have been 0.82d. per cub. yd. for wages, coal, oil, &amp;c., but
not including the salary of the superintendent.</p>

<p>An interesting example of a shore delivering dredger is a light
draught dredger constructed by Messrs Hunter &amp; English for the
Lakes of Albufera at the mouth of the river Ebro in Spain (Plate I.
fig. 6). The conditions laid down for this dredger were that it should
float in 18 in. of water and deliver the dredged material at 90 ft.
from the centre of its own hull. In order to meet these requirements
the vessel was made of steel plates <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. thick, and longitudinal
girders from end to end of the vessel, the upward strain of flotation
being conveyed to them from the skin plating by transverse bulkheads
at short intervals. The dredger was 94 ft. long, 25 ft. wide,
and 3 ft. deep, and the height of the top tumbler above the water
was 25 ft. When completed the dredger drew 17 in. of water. The
dredgings were delivered by the buckets upon an endless belt, driven
from the main compound surface-condensing engine, which ran over
pulleys supported upon a steel lattice girder, the outer end of which
rested upon an independent pontoon. This belt delivered the
dredgings at 90 ft. from the centre of the dredger round an arc of
180°. The dredger delivered 125 cub. yds. per hour of compact clay
at a cost of 1.16d. per cub. yd. or 0.86d. per ton for wages, coal and
stores. Another method of delivering dredgings is that of pneumatic
delivery, introduced by Mr F. E. Duckham, of the Millwall
Dock Co., by which the dredgings are delivered into cylindrical
tanks in the dredger, closed by air-tight doors, and are expelled by
compressed air either into the sea or through long pipes to the land.
The Millwall Dock dredger is 113 ft. long, with a beam of 17 ft. and
a depth of 12 ft. The draught loaded is 8 ft. It contains two
cylindrical tanks, having a combined capacity of 240 cub. yds., and
is fitted with compound engines of about 200 i.h.p., with a 20 in.
air-compressing cylinder. The discharge pipe is 15 in. diameter by
150 yds. long. The nozzles of the air-injection pipes must not be
too small, otherwise the compressed air, instead of driving out the
material, simply pierces holes through it and escapes through the
discharging pipe, carrying with it all the liquid and thin material in
the tanks. The cost of working the Millwall Dock dredger is given
by Mr Duckham at 1.75d. per cub. yd. of mud lifted, conveyed
and deposited on land 450 ft. from the water-side, for working expenses
only. This dredger is believed to be the first machine constructed
with a traversing ladder, as suggested by Captain Gibson
when dock-master of the Millwall Docks.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Blasting combined with Dredging.</i>&mdash;In some cases it has been
found that the bottom is too hard to be dredged until it has
been to some extent loosened and broken up. Thus at Newry,
John Rennie, after blasting the bottom in a depth of from 6 to
8 ft. at low water, removed the material by dredging at an
expense of from 4s. to 5s. per cub. yd. The same process was
adopted by Messrs Stevenson at the bar of the Erne at Ballyshannon,
where, in a situation exposed to a heavy sea, large
quantities of boulder stones were blasted, and afterwards raised
by a dredger worked by hand at a cost of 10s. 6d. per cub. yd.
Sir William Cubitt also largely employed blasting in connexion
with dredging on the Severn (see <i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> vol. iv. p. 362).
The cost of blasting and dredging the marl beds is given as being
4s. per cub. yd. A combination of blasting and dredging was
employed in 1875 by John Fowler of Stockton at the river Tees.
The chief novelty was in the barge upon which the machinery
was fixed. It was 58 ft. by 28 ft. by 4 ft., and had eight legs
which were let down when the barge was in position. The
legs were then fixed to the barge, so that on the tide falling it
became a fixed platform from which the drilling was done.
Holes were bored and charged, and when the tide rose the legs
were heaved up and the barge removed, after which the shots
were discharged. There were 24 boring tubes on the barge,
and that was the limit which could at any time be done in one
tide. The area over which the blasting was done measured
500 yds. in length by 200 in breadth, a small part being uncovered
at low water. The depth obtained in mid-channel was
14 ft. at low water, the average depth of rock blasted being about
4 ft. 6 in. The holes, which were bored with the diamond drill,
varied in depth from 7 to 9 ft., the distance between them
being 10 ft. Dynamite in tin canisters fired by patent fuse was
used as the explosive, the charges being 2 &#8468; and under. The
rock is oolite shale of variable hardness, and the average time
occupied in drilling holes 5 ft. deep was 12 minutes. The
dredger raised the blasted rock. The cost for blasting, lifting
and discharging at sea was about 4s. per cub. yd., including
interest on dredging and other plant employed. The dredger
sometimes worked a face of blasted material of from 7 to 8 ft.
The quantity blasted was 110,000 cub. yds., and the contract
for blasting so as to be lifted by the dredger was 3s. 1d. per cub.
yd. A similar plan was adopted at Blyth Harbour (see <i>Proc.
Inst. C.E.</i> vol. 81, p. 302). The cost of the explosives per cub.
yd. was 1s. 4d., of boring 1s. 9d. per cub. yd., and of dredging
3s. per cub. yd., including repairs, but nothing for the use of
plant. The whole cost worked out at 6s. 1d. per cub. yd. on
the average.</p>

<p><i>Sand-pump Dredgers.</i>&mdash;Perhaps the most important development
which has taken place in dredging during recent years has
been the employment of sand-pump dredgers, which are very
useful for removing sandy bars where the particular object is to
remove quickly a large quantity of sand or other soft material.
They are, however, apt to make large holes, and are therefore
not fitted for positions where it is necessary to finish off the
dredging work to a uniform flat bottom, for which purpose
bucket dredgers are better adapted. Pump dredgers are, however,
admirable and economical machines for carrying out the
work for which they are specially suited.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In the discussion upon Mr J. J. Webster&rsquo;s paper upon &ldquo;Dredging-Appliances&rdquo;
(<i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> vol. 89) at the Institution of Civil
Engineers in 1886, Sir John Coode stated that he had first seen sand-pump
dredgers at the mouth of the Maas in Holland. The centrifugal
pump was placed against the bulkheads in the after part of the
vessel, and the sand and water were delivered into a horizontal
breeches-piece leading into two pipes running along the full length
of the hopper. The difficulty of preventing the sand from running
overboard was entirely obviated by its being propelled by the pump
through these pipes, the bottoms of which were perforated by a series
of holes. In addition, there were a few small flap-doors fixed at
intervals, by means of which the men were able to regulate the
discharge. On being tested, the craft pumped into its hopper 400
tons of sand in 22 minutes. The coamings round the well of the
hoppers were constructed with a dip, and when the hopper was full
the water ran over in a steady stream on either side. The proportion
of sand delivered into the hopper was about 20% of the total
capacity of the pump. The dredger was constructed by Messrs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page566" id="page566"></a>566</span>
Smit of Kinderdijk, near Rotterdam. In the same discussion
Mr A. A. Langley, then engineer to the Great Eastern railway, gave
particulars of a sand pump upon the Bazin system, which had been
used successfully at Lowestoft. The boat was 60 ft. long by 20 ft.
wide, and the pump was 2 ft. in diameter, with a two-bladed disk.
The discharge pipe was 12 in. in diameter. The pump raised 400
tons of sand, gravel and stones per hour as a maximum quantity,
the average quantity being about 200 tons per hour. The depth
dredged was from 7 ft. to 25 ft. The pump was driven by a double-cylinder
engine, having cylinders of 9 in. diameter by 10 in. stroke,
and making 120 revolutions per minute. An important improvement
was made by fitting the working faces of the pump with india-rubber,
which was very successful and largely reduced the wear and tear.
The cost of the dredging at Lowestoft was given by Mr Langley at
2d. per ton, including delivery 2 m. out at sea. The quantity
dredged was about 200,000 tons per annum.</p>

<p>One of the earliest pumps to be applied to dredging purposes was
the Woodford, which consisted of a horizontal disk with two or
more arms working in a case somewhat similar to the ordinary
centrifugal pump. The disk was keyed to a vertical shaft which was
driven from above by means of belts or other gear coupled to an
ordinary portable engine. The pump within rested on the ground;
the suction pipe was so arranged that water was drawn in with the
sand or mud, the proportions being regulated to suit the quality of
the material. The discharge pipe was rectangular and carried a
vertical shaft, the whole apparatus being adjustable to suit different
depths of water. This arrangement was very effective, and has been
used on many works. Burt &amp; Freeman&rsquo;s sand pump, a modification
of the Woodford pump, was used in the construction of the Amsterdam
Ship Canal, for which it was designed. The excavations from
the canal had to be deposited on the banks some distance away from
the dredgers, and after being raised by the ordinary bucket dredger,
instead of being discharged into the barges, they were led into a
vertical chamber on the top side of the pump, suitable arrangements
being made for regulating the delivery. The pump was 3½ ft. in
diameter, and made about 230 revolutions per minute. The water
was drawn up on the bottom side and mixed with the descending
mud on the top side, and the two were discharged into a pipe 15 in.
in diameter. The discharge pipe was a special feature, and consisted
of a series of wooden pipes jointed together with leather hinges
and floated on buoys from the dredger to the bank. In some cases
this pipe was 300 yds. long, and discharged the material 8 ft. above
the water level. Each dredger and pump was capable of discharging
an average of 1500 cub. yds. per day of 12 hours. Schmidt&rsquo;s
sand pump is claimed to be an improvement on the Burt &amp; Freeman
pump. It consists of a revolving wheel 6 ft. in diameter, with cutters
revolving under a hood which just allows the water to pass underneath.
To the top side of the hood a 20 in. suction pipe from an
ordinary centrifugal pump is attached. The pump is driven by two
16 in. by 20 in. cylinders, at 134 revolutions per minute, the boiler
pressure being 95 &#8468; per sq. in. This apparatus is capable of excavating
sticky blue clayey mud, and will deliver the material at
500 to 650 yds. distance. The best results are obtained when the
mixture of mud and water is as 1 to 6.5. The average quantity
excavated per diem by the apparatus is 1300 cub. yds., the maximum
quantity being 2500 cub. yds.</p>

<p>Kennard&rsquo;s sand pump is entirely different from the pumps already
described, and is a direct application of the ordinary lift pump. A
wrought iron box has a suction pipe fitted at the bottom, rising about
half way up the inside of the box; on the top of the box is fitted the
actual pump and the flap valves. The apparatus is lowered by
chains, and the pump lowered from above. As soon as the box is
filled with sand it is raised, the catches holding up the bottom
released, and the contents discharged into a punt.</p>

<p>Sand-pump dredgers, designed and arranged by Mr Darnton
Hutton, were extensively used on the Amsterdam Ship Canal. A
centrifugal pump with a fan 4 ft. in diameter was employed, the
suction and delivery pipes, each 18 in. in diameter, being attached
to an open wrought-iron framework. The machine was suspended
between guides fixed to the end of the vessel, which was fitted with
tackle for raising, lowering and adjusting the machine. The vessel
was fitted with a steam engine and boiler for working and manipulating
the pumps and the heavy side chains for the guidance of the
dredger. The engine was 70 h.p., and the total cost of one dredger
was £8000. The number of hands required for working this sand-pump
dredger was one captain, one engineer, one stoker and four
sailors. Each machine was capable of raising about 1300 tons of
material per day, the engines working at 60 and the pump at 180
revolutions per minute. The sand was delivered into barges alongside
the dredger. The cost of raising the material and depositing
it in barges was about 1d. per ton when the sand pumps were working,
but upon the year&rsquo;s work the cost was 2.4d. per cub. yd. for
working expenses and repairs, and 1.24d. per cub. yd. for interest
and depreciation at 10% upon the cost of the plant, making a total
cost for dredging of 3.64d. per cub. yd. The cost for transport was
3.588d. per cub. yd., making a total cost for dredging and transport
of 7.234d. per cub. yd. Dredging and transport on the same works
by an ordinary bucket dredger and barges cost 8.328d. per cub. yd.</p>

<p>Two of the largest and most successful instances of sand-pump
dredgers are the &ldquo;Brancker&rdquo; and the &ldquo;G. B. Crow,&rdquo; belonging
to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. Mr A. G. Lyster gave
particulars of the work done by these dredgers in a paper read before
the Engineering Congress in 1899. They are each 320 ft. long, 47 ft.
wide and 20.5 ft. deep, the draught loaded being 16 ft. They are
fitted with two centrifugal pumps, each 6 ft. in diameter, with 36 in.
suction and delivery pipes, united into a 45 in. diameter pipe, hung
by a ball and socket joint in a trunnion, so as to work safely in a seaway
when the waves are 10 ft. high. The suction pipe is 76 ft. long
and will dredge in 53 ft. of water. The eight hoppers hold 3000 tons,
equivalent when solid to 2000 cub. yds.; they can be filled in three-quarters
of an hour and discharged in five minutes. Mr Lyster
stated that up to May 1899, the quantity removed from bar and
main-channel shoals amounted to 41,240,360 tons, giving a width
of channel of 1500 ft. through the bar, with a minimum depth of
27 ft. The cost of dredging on the bar by the &ldquo;G. B. Crow&rdquo; during
1898, when 4,309,350 tons of material were removed, was 0.61d.
per ton for wages, supplies and repairs. These figures include all
direct working costs and a proportion of the charge for actual
superintendence, but no allowance for interest on capital cost or
depreciation. On an average, 20% of the sand and mud that are
raised escapes over the side of the vessel. Mr Lyster has, however,
to a considerable extent overcome this difficulty by a special
arrangement added to the hoppers (see <i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> vol. 188).</p>

<p>At the Engineering Conference, 1907, Mr Lyster read a note in
which he stated that the total quantity of material removed from
the bar of the Mersey, from the Crosby channel, and from other
points of the main channel by the &ldquo;G. B. Crow&rdquo; and &ldquo;Brancker&rdquo;
suction dredgers amounted to 108,675,570 tons up to the 1st of May
1907. &ldquo;In the note of 1899 (he added) it was pointed out that the
Mersey was a striking instance of the improvement of a river by
dredging rather than by permanent works, and the economy of the
system as well as the advantage which its elasticity and adaptability
to varying circumstances permit, was pointed out....
The most recent experience, which has resulted in the adoption of
the proposal to revet the Taylor&rsquo;s bank, indicates that the dredging
method has its limitations and cannot provide for every contingency
which is likely to arise; at the same time, the utility and economy
of the dredging system is in no way diminished.... Having
regard to the ever-increasing size of vessels, a scheme for new docks
and entrances on a very large scale received the authority of parliament
during the session of 1905-1906 In this scheme it was considered
necessary to make provision for vessels of 1000 ft. in length
and 40 ft. in draught, and having regard to this prospective growth
of vessels it has been determined still further to deepen and improve
the outer channel of the Mersey. No fixed measure of improvement
has been decided on, but after careful survey of existing conditions
and a comparison with probable requirements, it has been determined
to construct a dredger of 10,000 tons capacity, provided with pumping
power equivalent to about three times that of any existing
dredgers. By the use of this vessel it is anticipated that it will be
possible to deal with very much larger quantities of sand at a cheaper
rate, and to 10 ft. greater depth than the existing plant permits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The vessel in question was launched on the Mersey from the yard
of Messrs Cammell, Laird &amp; Co. in October 1908, and was named
the &ldquo;Leviathan.&rdquo; Her length is 487 ft., beam 69 ft., and depth
30 ft. 7 in. Her dredging machinery consists of four centrifugal
pumps driven by four sets of inverted triple expansion engines, and
connected to four suction tubes 90 ft. long and 42 in. in internal
diameter. Her propelling machinery, consisting of two sets of triple
expansion engines, is capable of driving her at a speed of 10 knots.</p>

<p>Another powerful and successful sand-pump dredger, &ldquo;Kate&rdquo;
(Plate I. fig. 7), was built in 1897 by Messrs Wm. Simons &amp; Co. Ltd.
for the East London Harbour Board, South Africa. Its dimensions
are: length 200 ft., breadth 39 ft., depth 14 ft. 6 in., hopper capacity
1000 tons. The pumping arrangements for filling the hopper with
sand or discharging overboard consist of two centrifugal pumps,
each driven from one of the propelling engines. The suction pipes
are each 27 in. in diameter, and are so arranged that they may be
used for pumping either forward or aft, as the state of the weather
may require. Four steam cranes are provided for manipulating the
suction pipes. Owing to the exceptional weather with which the
vessel had to contend, special precautions were taken in designing
the attachments of the suction pipes to the vessel. The attachment
is above deck and consists of a series of joints, which give a perfectly
free and universal movement to the upper ends of the pipes. The
joints, on each side of the vessel, are attached to a carriage, which
is traversed laterally by hydraulic gear. By this means the pipes
are pushed out well clear of the vessel&rsquo;s sides when pumping, and
brought inboard when not in work. Hydraulic cushioning cylinders
are provided to give any required resistance to the fore and aft
movements of the pipes. When the vessel arrived at East London
on the 18th of July 1897, there was a depth of 14 ft. on the bar at
high tide. On the 10th of October, scarcely three months afterwards,
there was a depth of 20 ft. on the bar at low water. Working 22 days
in rough weather during the month of November 1898, the &ldquo;Kate&rdquo;
raised and deposited 2½ m. at sea 60,000 tons of dredgings. Her
best day&rsquo;s work (12 hours) was on the 7th of November, when she
dredged and deposited 6440 tons.</p>

<p>A large quantity of sand-pump dredging has been carried out at
Boulogne and Calais by steam hopper pump dredgers, workable when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page567" id="page567"></a>567</span>
the head waves are not more than 3 ft. high and the cross waves not
more than 1½ ft. high. The dredgings are taken 2 m. to sea, and the
price for dredging and depositing from 800,000 to 900,000 cub.
metres in 5 or 6 years was 7.25d. per cub. yd. The contractor offered
to do the work at 4.625d. per cub. yd. on condition of being allowed
to work either at Calais or Boulogne, as the weather might permit.
Sand-pump dredging has also been extensively carried out at the
mouth of the ports of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and on the north coast
of France by sand dredgers constructed by Messrs L. Smit &amp; Son
and G. &amp; K. Smit. The largest dredger, the &ldquo;Amsterdam,&rdquo; is
141 ft. by 27 ft. by 10 ft. 8 in., and has engines of 190 i.h.p. The
hopper capacity is 10,600 cub. ft., and the vessel can carry 600 tons
of dredgings. The pump fan is 6 ft. 3 in. in diameter by 10 in. wide,
the plates being of wrought iron, and makes 130 revolutions a minute.
The pump can raise 230 cub. ft. a minute from a depth of 33 ft.,
which, taking the proportion of 1 of sand to 7 of water, gives a
delivery of 29 cub. ft. of sand per minute. The hopper containing
10,600 cub. ft. was under favourable circumstances filled in 40
minutes. The vessels are excellent sea boats.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Combined Bucket-Ladder and Sand-Pump Dredgers.</i>&mdash;Bucket
ladders and sand pumps have also been fitted to the same
dredger. A successful example of this practice is furnished by
the hopper dredger &ldquo;Percy Sanderson&rdquo; (Plate I. fig. 8), constructed
under the direction of Sir C. A. Hartley, engineer of
the Danube Commission for the deepening of the river Danube
and the Sulina bar. This dredger is 220 ft. by 40 ft. by 17 ft.
2 in., and has a hopper capacity for 1250 tons of dredgings.
The buckets have each a capacity of 25 cub. ft., and are able
to raise 1000 tons of ordinary material per hour. The suction
pump, which is driven by an independent set of triple expansion
engines, is capable of raising 700 tons of sand per hour, and of
dredging to a depth of 35 ft. below the water-line. The lower
end of the suction pipe is controlled by special steam appliances
by which the pipe can be brought entirely inboard. The &ldquo;Percy
Sanderson&rdquo; raises and deposits on an average 5000 tons of
material per day.</p>

<p><i>Grab Dredgers.</i>&mdash;The grab dredger was stated by Sir Benjamin
Baker (<i>Proc. Inst. C.E.</i> vol. 113, p. 38) to have been invented by
Gouffé in 1703, and was worked by two ropes and a bar. Various
kinds of apparatus have been designed in the shape of grabs or
buckets for dredging purposes. These are usually worked by a
steam crane, which lets the open grab down to the surface of
the ground to be excavated and then closes it by a chain which
forces the tines into the ground; the grab is then raised by the
crane, which deposits the contents either into the hopper of the
vessel upon which the crane is fixed or into another barge.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Priestman grab has perhaps been more extensively used than
any other apparatus of this sort. It is very useful for excavating
mud, gravel and soft sand, but is less effective with hard sand or
stiff clay&mdash;a general defect in this class of dredger. It is also capable
of lifting large loose pieces of rock weighing from 1 to 2 tons. A
dredger of this type, with grab holding 1 ton of mud, dredged during
six days, in 19 ft. of water, an average of 52½ tons and a maximum
of 68½ tons per hour, and during 12 days, in 16 ft. of water, an
average of 48 tons and a maximum of 58 tons per hour, at a cost of
1.63d. per ton, excluding interest on the capital and depreciation.
The largest dredger to which this apparatus has been applied is the
grab bucket hopper dredger &ldquo;Miles K. Burton&rdquo; (Plate I. fig. 9),
belonging to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. It is equipped
with 5 grabs on Morgan&rsquo;s patent system, which is a modification of
Priestman&rsquo;s, the grabs being worked by 5 hydraulic cranes. It
raised and deposited, 12 to 15 m. at sea, 11 loads of about 1450 tons
each with a double shift of hands, at a cost of about 1s. 5d. per cub.
yd. of spoil, including the working expenses for wages of crew, fuel
and stores. Mr R. A. Marillier of Hull has stated that &ldquo;the efficiency
of these grabs is not at all dependent upon the force of the blow in
falling for the penetration and grip in the material, as they do their
work very satisfactorily even when lowered quite gently on to the
material to be cut out, the jaws being so framed as to draw down
and penetrate the material as soon as the upward strain is put on
the lifting chain. Even in hard material the jaws penetrate so
thoroughly as to cause the bucket to be well filled. The grab is found
to work successfully in excavating hard clay from its natural bed
on dry land.&rdquo; It is claimed on behalf of grabs that they lift a smaller
proportion of water than any other class of dredger.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the 20th century considerable advance has
been made in the use of Priestman grabs, not only for dredging and
excavating (for which work they were originally designed), but also
in discharging bulk cargo. The first quadruple dredger used by the
Liverpool Docks Board had grabs of a capacity of 30 cub. ft., but
subsequently second and third quadruple dredgers were put to work
in the Liverpool Docks, with grabs having a capacity of 70 and 100
cub. ft. respectively. In discharging coal at Southampton, Havre,
Erith, as well as at the coaling station at Purfleet on the Thames,
grabs having a capacity of about 80 cub. ft. are in constant use.
Perhaps the most difficult kind of bulk cargo to lift is &ldquo;Narvick&rdquo;
iron ore, which sets into a semi-solid body in the holds of the vessels,
and for this purpose one of the largest grabs, having about 150 cub.
ft. capacity and weighing about 8 tons, has been adopted. This grab
was designed as a result of experiments extending over a long period
in lifting iron ore. It is fitted with long, forged, interlocked steel
teeth for penetrating the compact material, which is very costly to
remove by hand labour. The Priestman grab is made to work with
either one or two chains or wire ropes. Grabs worked with two
chains or ropes have many advantages, and are therefore adopted
for large undertakings.</p>

<p>Wild&rsquo;s single chain half-tine grab works entirely with a single
chain, and has been found very useful in excavating the cylinders in
Castries harbour. Upon experimenting with an ordinary grab a
rather curious condition of things was observed with respect to
sinking. On penetrating the soil to a certain depth the ground was
found as it were nested, and nothing would induce the grab to sink
lower. Sir W. Matthews suggested that a further set of external
tines might possibly get over this difficulty. A new grab having been
made with this modification, and also with a large increase of
weight&mdash;all the parts being of steel&mdash;it descended to any required
depth with ease, the outside tines loosening the ground effectually
whilst the inside bucket or tines picked up the material.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Miscellaneous Appliances.</i>&mdash;There are several machines or
appliances which perhaps can hardly be called dredgers, although
they are used for cleansing and deepening rivers and harbours.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Kingfoot&rsquo;s dredger, used for cleansing the river Stour, consisted
of a boat with a broad rake fitted to the bow, capable of adjustment
to different depths. At the sides of the boat were hinged two wings
of the same depth as the rake and in a line with it. When the rake
was dropped to the bottom of the river and the wings extended to
the side, they formed a sort of temporary dam, and the water began
to rise gradually. As soon as a sufficient head was raised, varying
from 6 to 12 in., the whole machine was driven forward by the
pressure, and the rake carried the mud with it. Progress at the rate
of about 3 m. an hour was made in this manner, and to prevent the
accumulation of the dredgings, operations were begun at the mouth
of the river and carried on backwards. The apparatus was very
effective and the river was cleansed thoroughly, but the distance
travelled by the dredger must have been great.</p>

<p>In 1876 J. J. Rietschoten designed a &ldquo;propeller dredger&rdquo; for
removing the shoals of the river Maas. It consisted of an old gunboat
fitted with a pair of trussed beams, one at each side, each of
which carried a steel shaft and was capable of being lowered or
raised by means of a crab. An ordinary propeller 3 ft. 6 in. in
diameter was fixed to the lower end of the shaft, and driven by bevel
gear from a cross shaft which derived its motion by belting from
the fly-wheel of a 12 h.p. portable engine. The propellers were
lowered until they nearly reached the shoals, and were then worked
at 150 revolutions per minute. This operation scoured away the
shoal effectively, for in about 40 minutes it had been lowered about
3 ft. for a space of 150 yds. long by 8 yds. wide.</p>

<p>A. Lavalley in 1877 designed an arrangement for the harbour of
Dunkirk to overcome the difficulty of working an ordinary bucket-ladder
dredger when there is even a small swell. A pump injects
water into the sand down a pipe terminating in three nozzles to stir
up the sand, and another centrifugal pump draws up the mixed
sand and water and discharges it into a hopper, the pumps and all
machinery being on board the hopper. To allow for the rising and
falling of the vessel&mdash;either by the action of the tide or by the swell&mdash;the
ends of the pipes are made flexible. The hopper has a capacity
of 190 cub. yds., and is propelled and the pumps worked by an engine
of 150 i.h.p. From 50 to 80 cub. yds. per hour can be raised by this
dredger.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Aquamotrice,&rdquo; designed by Popie, and used on the
Garonne at Agen, appears to be a modification of the old bag and
spoon arrangement. A flat-bottomed boat 51½ ft. long by 6½ ft.
wide was fitted at the bow with paddles, which were actuated by the
tide. Connected with the paddles was a long chain, passing over a
pulley on uprights and under a roller, and a beam was attached to
the chain 14 ft. 8 in. long, passing through a hole in the deck. At
the end of the beam was an iron scoop 2 ft. wide and 2 ft. 6 in. deep.
When the tide was strong enough it drew the scoop along by means
of the paddles and chains, and the scoop when filled was opened by
a lever and discharged. About 65 cub. yds. of gravel could be
raised by the apparatus in 12 hours. When the tide failed the
apparatus was worked by men.</p>

<p>The Danube Steam Navigation Co. removed the shingle in the
shallow parts of the river by means of a triangular rake with wrought-iron
sides 18 ft. long, and fitted with 34 teeth of chilled cast iron
12 in. deep. This rake was hung from the bow of a steamer 180 ft.
long by 21 ft. beam, and dragged across the shallows, increasing the
depth of water in one instance from 5 ft. 6 in. to 9 ft., after passing
over the bank 355 times.</p>

<p>A combination of a harrow and high pressure water jets, arranged
by B. Tydeman, was found very efficacious in removing a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page568" id="page568"></a>568</span>
quantity of mud which accumulated in the Tilbury Dock basin,
which has an area of about 17 acres, with a depth of 26 ft. at low-water
spring tides. In the first instance chain harrows merely were
used, but the addition of the water jets added materially to the
success of the operation. The system accomplished in six tides
more than was done in twelve tides without the water jets which
worked at about 80 lb pressure per sq. in. at the bottom of the dock.</p>

<p>Ive&rsquo;s excavator consists of a long weighted spear, with a sort of
spade at the end of it. The spade is hinged at the top, and is capable
of being turned at right angles to the spear by a chain attached to
the end of the spear. The spade is driven into the ground, and after
releasing the catch which holds it in position during its descent, it is
drawn up at right angles to the spear by the chain, carrying the
material with it. Milroy&rsquo;s excavator is similar, but instead of having
only one spade it generally has eight, united to the periphery of an
octagonal iron frame fixed to a central vertical rod. When these
eight spades are drawn up by means of chains, they form one flat
table or tray at right angles to the central rod. In operation the
spades hang vertically, and are dropped into the material to be
excavated; the chains are then drawn up, and the table thus formed
holds the material on the top, which is lifted and discharged by
releasing the spade. This apparatus has been extensively used both
in Great Britain and in India for excavating in bridge cylinders.</p>

<p>The clam shell dredger consists of two hinged buckets, which when
closed form one semi-cylindrical bucket. The buckets are held
open by chains attached to the top of a cross-head, and the machine
is dropped on to the top of the material to be dredged. The chains
holding the bucket open are then released, while the spears are held
firmly in position, the buckets being closed by another chain.
Bull&rsquo;s dredger, Gatmell&rsquo;s excavator, and Fouracre&rsquo;s dredger are
modifications with improvements of the clam shell dredger, and
have all been used successfully upon various works.</p>

<p>Bruce &amp; Batho&rsquo;s dredger, when closed, is of hemispherical form,
the bucket being composed of three or four blades. It can be worked
by either a single chain or by means of a spear, the latter being
generally used for stiff material. The advantage of this form of
dredger bucket is that the steel points of the blades are well adapted
for penetrating hard material. Messrs Bruce &amp; Batho also designed
a dredger consisting of one of these buckets, but worked entirely
by hydraulic power. This was made for working on the Tyne.
The excavator or dredger is fixed to the end of a beam which is
actuated by two hydraulic cylinders, one being used for raising the
bucket and the other for lowering it; the hydraulic power is supplied
by the pumps in the engine-room. The novelty in the design is the
ingenious way in which the lever in ascending draws the shoot under
the bucket to receive its contents, and draws away again as the
bucket descends. The hydraulic cylinder at the end of the beam
is carried on gimbals to allow for irregularities on the surface being
dredged. The hydraulic pressure is 700 &#8468; per sq. in., and the pumps
are used in connexion with a steam accumulator.</p>

<p>An unloading apparatus was designed by Mr A. Manning for the
East &amp; West India Dock Co. for unloading the dredged materials
out of barges and delivering it on the marsh at the back of the bank
of the river Thames at Crossness, Kent. A stage constructed of
wooden piles commanded a series of barge beds, and the unloading
dredger running from end to end of the stage, lifted and delivered
the materials on the marsh behind the river wall at the cost of 1 d.
per cub. yd.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Dredging on the River Scheldt below Antwerp.</i>&mdash;This dredging
took place at Krankeloon and the Belgian Sluis under the direction
of L. Van Gansberghe. At Melsele there is a pronounced
bend in the river, causing a bar at the Pass of Port Philip,
and just below the pass of Lillo there is a cross-over in the current,
making a neutral point and forming a shoal. After dredging to
8 metres (26.24 ft.) below low tide, in clay containing stone
and ferruginous matter, a sandstone formation was encountered,
which was very compact and difficult to raise. A suction
dredger being unsuited to the work, a bucket-ladder dredger
was employed. The dredging was commenced at Krankeloon
in September 1894 and continued to the end of 1897. A depth
of 6 metres (19.68 ft.) was excavated at first, but was afterwards
increased to 8 metres (26.24 ft.). The place of deposit was at
first on lands acquired by the State, 2.17 m. above Krankeloon,
and placed at the disposal of the contractor. The dredgings
excavated by the bucket-ladder dredger were deposited in scows,
which were towed to the front of the deposit ground and discharged
by a suction pump fixed in a special boat, moored close
to the bank of the river. The material brought by the suction
dredger in its own hull was discharged by a plant fixed upon the
dredger itself. In both instances the material was deposited at
a distance of 1640 ft. from the river, the spoil bank varying
in depth from 2 to 7 metres. The water thrown out behind
the dyke with the excavated material returned to the river,
after settlement, by a special discharge lock built under the dyke.
After 1896 the material was delivered into an abandoned pass
by means of barges with bottom hopper doors or by the suction
dredger. One suction dredger and three bucket-ladder dredgers
were employed upon the work, and a vessel called &ldquo;Scheldt I.&rdquo;
used for discharging the material from the scows. Four tugboats
and twenty scows were also employed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The largest dredger, &ldquo;Scheldt III.,&rdquo; was 147.63 ft. long by 22.96
ft. wide by 10.98 ft. deep, and had buckets of 21.18 cub. ft. capacity.
The output per hour was 10,594 cub. ft. This dredger had also a
complete installation as a suction dredger, the suction pipe being
2 ft. diameter. The fan of the centrifugal pump was 5.25 ft. diameter,
and was driven by the motor of the bucket ladder. The three bucket
dredgers worked with head to the ebb tide. They could also work
with head to the flood tide, but it took so long a time to turn them
about that it was impracticable. The work was for from 13 to 14
hours a day on the ebb tide. The effective daily excavation
averaged 4839 cub. yds. Each dredger was fitted with six anchors.
The excavated cut was 164 ft. wide by 6.56 ft. deep. &ldquo;Scheldt III.&rdquo;
was capable of lifting a mass 9.84 ft. thick. The suction dredger
&ldquo;Scheldt II.&rdquo; was of the multiple type, and is stated to be unique
in construction. It can discharge material from a scow alongside,
fill its own hopper with excavations, discharge its own load upon the
bank or into a scow by different pipes provided for the purpose, and
discharge its own load through hopper doors. The machinery is
driven by a triple expansion engine of 300 i.h.p. working the propeller
by a clutch. Owing to the rise and fall in the tide of 23 ft.
the suction pipe is fitted with spherical joints and a telescopic
arrangement. The vessel is 157.5 ft. by 28.2 ft. by 12.8 ft. The
diameter of the pump is 5.25 ft. The wings of the pump are curved,
the surface being in the form of a cylinder parallel to the axis of
rotation, the directrix of which is an arc of a circle of 2.62 ft. radius
with the straight part beyond. The suction and discharge pipes are
2 ft. diameter. A centrifugal pump is provided for throwing water
into the scows to liquefy the material during discharge. The dredger,
which is fitted with electric lights for work at night, is held by two
anchors, to prevent lurching backwards and forwards; it can work
on the flood as well as on the ebb tide, and can excavate to a depth
of 42.65 ft., the output depending upon the nature of the material.
With good material it can fill its tanks in thirty minutes. To empty
the tanks by suction and discharge upon the bank over the dyke
takes about fifty minutes, depending upon the height and distance
to which the material requires to be delivered. The daily work has
averaged eighteen hours, ten trips being made when the distance
from the dredging ground to the point of delivery is about 1 m.
When the dredged material is discharged into the Scheldt, a quantity
of 5886 cub. yds. has been raised and deposited in a day, the mean
quantity being 4700 cub. yds. When the distance of transportation
is increased to 2½ m., six voyages were made in a day, and the day&rsquo;s
work amounted to 3530 cub. yds.</p>

<p class="center pt2 sc">2. Marine Biology</p>

<p>The naturalist&rsquo;s dredge is an instrument consisting essentially
of a net or bag attached to a framework of iron which forms the
mouth of the net. When in use as the apparatus is drawn over
the sea-bottom mouth forwards, some part of the framework
passes beneath objects which it meets and so causes them to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page569" id="page569"></a>569</span>
enter the net. It is intended for the collection of animals and
plants living on or near the sea-bottom, or sometimes of specimens
of the sea-bottom itself, for scientific purposes.</p>

<p>Until the middle of the 18th century, naturalists who studied
the marine fauna and flora relied for their materials on shore
collection and the examination of the catches of fishing boats.
Their knowledge of creatures living below the level of low spring
tides was thus gained only from specimens cast up in storms, or
caught by fishing gear designed for the capture of certain edible
species only. The first effort made to free
marine biology from these limitations was
the use of the dredge, which was built
much on the plan of the oyster dredge.</p>

Frederick Müller&rsquo;s
Dredge (1770).</td></tr></table>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>The Oyster Dredge.</i>&mdash;At first naturalists made
use of the ordinary oyster dredge, which is
constructed as follows. The frame is an iron
triangle, the sides being the round iron &ldquo;arms&rdquo;
of the dredge, the base a flat bar called the
shere or lip, which is sloped a little, not perpendicular
to the plane of the triangle; an
iron bar parallel to the base joins the arms.
The net is fastened to the parallel bars and
the portion of the arms between them, and
consists of two parts: that attached to the
shere is of round iron rings linked together by
smaller ones of wire lashings, that attached
to the upper bar is of ordinary network.
Where these two portions of the bag meet a
wooden beam is fastened. In use the frame is towed forward by its
apex: the shere passes below oysters, &amp;c., which pass back on to the
iron netting. The length of each side of the triangular frame is about
6 ft., the width of the shere 3 in. and the height of the mouth just
under a foot. The rings vary in size, but are usually some 2½ in. in
diameter. The weight is about 60 &#8468;. This dredge was soon abandoned:
its weight was prohibitive for small boats, from which the
naturalist usually worked, its wide rings allowed precious specimens
to fall through, and its shallow net favoured the washing out of light
objects on hauling through the moving water of the surface. Moreover,
it sometimes fell on its back and was then useless, although
when the apex or towing point was weighted no great skill is needed
to avoid this.</p>

<p>Otho Müller used a dredge (fig. 13) consisting of a net with a
square iron mouth, each of whose sides was furnished with a thin
edge turned slightly away from the dredge&rsquo;s centre. As any one of
these everted lips could act as a scraper it was a matter of indifference
which struck the bottom when the dredge
was lowered. The chief defect of the instrument
was the ease with which light objects
could be washed out on hauling, owing to
the size of the mouth. However, with this
instrument Müller obtained from the often
stormy Scandinavian seas all the material for
his celebrated <i>Zoologia Danica</i>, a description
of the marine fauna of Denmark and
Norway which was published with excellent
coloured plates in 1778; and historical
interest attaches to the dredge as the first
made specially for scientific work.</p>

<p><i>Ball&rsquo;s Dredge.</i>&mdash;About 1838 a dredge devised
by Dr Ball of Dublin was introduced.
It has been used all over the world, and is
so apt for its purpose that it has suffered
very little modification during its 70 years
of life. It is known as Ball&rsquo;s dredge or more
generally simply &ldquo;the dredge.&rdquo;</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 230px;" summary="Illustration">
<tr><td class="figright1"><img style="width:176px; height:379px" src="images/img569b.jpg" alt="" /></td></tr>
<tr><td class="caption1"><span class="sc">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;Ball&rsquo;s
Naturalist&rsquo;s Dredge.</td></tr></table>

<p>Ball&rsquo;s dredge (fig. 14) consists of a rectangular
net attached to a rectangular
frame much longer than high, and furnished
with rods stretching from the four corners
to meet at a point where they are attached
to the dredge rope. It differs from Müller&rsquo;s
dredge in the slit-like shape of the opening,
which prevents much of the &ldquo;washing out&rdquo; suffered by the earlier
pattern, and in the edges. The long edges only are fashioned as
scrapers, being wider and heavier than Müller&rsquo;s, especially in later
dredges. The short edges are of round iron bar.</p>

<p>Like Müller&rsquo;s form, Ball&rsquo;s dredge will act whichever side touches
the bottom first, as its frame will not remain on its short edge, and
either of the long edges acts as a scraper. The scraping lips thicken
gradually from free edge to net; they are set at 110° to the plane of
the mouth, and in some later patterns curve outwards instead of
merely sloping. All dredge frames are of wrought iron.</p>

<p>The thick inner edges of the scrapers are perforated by round
holes at distances of about an inch, and through these strong iron
rings about an inch in diameter are passed, and two or three similar
rings run on the short rods which form the ends of the dredge-frame.
A light iron rod, bent to the form of the dredge opening, usually runs
through these rings, and to this rod and to the rings the mouth of
the dredge-bag is securely attached by stout cord or strong copper
wire. Various materials have been used for the bag, the chief of
which are hide, canvas and netting. The hide was recommended
by its strength, but it is now abandoned. Canvas bags fill quickly
with mud or sand and then cease to operate: on the other hand
wide mesh net fails to retain small specimens. Probably the most
suitable material is hand-made netting of very strong twine, the
meshes half an inch to the side, the inter-spaces contracting to a
third of an inch across when the twine is thoroughly soaked, with an
open canvas or &ldquo;bread-bag&rdquo; lining to the last 6 in. of the net. A
return to canvas covering has latterly occurred in the small dredge
called the mud-bag, trailed behind the trawl of the &ldquo;Albatross&rdquo;
for obtaining a sample of the bottom, and in the conical dredge.</p>

<p>The dimensions of the first dredges were as follows: Frame about
12 in. by about 4 in.; scraping lips about 2 in. wide; all other iron
parts of round iron bar <span class="spp">5</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">8</span> in. diameter; bag rather more than 1 ft.
long. These small dredges were used from rowing boats. Larger
dredges were subsequently made for use from yawls or cutters.
The mouth of these was 18 by 5 in., the scraping lips about 2 in.
wide and bag 2 ft. deep; such a dredge weighs about 20 &#8468;. The
dredge of the &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; had a frame 4 ft. 6 in. by 1 ft. 3 in. and
the bag had a length of 4 ft. 6 in.; the &ldquo;Porcupine&rdquo; used a dredge
of the same size weighing 225 &#8468;. Doubtless the size of Ball&rsquo;s dredge
would have grown still more had it not been proved by the
&ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; expedition that for many purposes trawls could be
used advantageously instead of dredges.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Operation of the Dredge from Small Vessels.</i> For work round
the coasts of Europe, at depths attainable from a row-boat or
yawl, probably the best kind of line is bolt-rope of the best
Russian hemp, not less than 1½ in. in circumference, containing
18 to 20 yarns in 3 strands. Each yarn should be nearly a
hundredweight, so that the breaking strain of such a rope ought
to be about a ton. Of course it is never voluntarily exposed to
such a strain, but in shallow water the dredge is often caught
among rocks or coral, and the rope should be strong enough in
such a case to bring up the boat, even if there were some little
way on. It is always well, when dredging, to ascertain the
approximate depth with the lead before casting the dredge; and
the lead ought always to be accompanied by a registering
thermometer, for the subsequent haul of the dredge will gain
greatly in value as an observation in geographical distribution,
if it be accompanied by an accurate note of the bottom temperature.
For depths under 100 fathoms the amount of rope
paid out should be at least double the depth; under 30 fathoms,
where one usually works more rapidly, it should be more nearly
three times; this gives a good deal of slack before the dredge if
the boat be moving very slowly, and keeps the lip of the dredge
well down. When there is anything of a current, from whatever
cause, it is usually convenient to attach a weight, varying from
14 &#8468; to half a hundredweight, to the rope 3 or 4 fathoms in front
of the dredge. This prevents in some degree the lifting of the
mouth of the dredge; if the weight be attached nearer the dredge
it is apt to injure delicate objects passing in.</p>

<p>In dredging in sand or mud, the dredge-rope may simply be
passed through the double eye formed by the ends of the two
arms of the dredge-frame; but in rocky or unknown ground it is
better to fasten the rope to the eye of one of the arms only, and to
tie the two eyes together with three or four turns of rope-yarn.
This stop breaks much more readily than the dredge-rope, so that
if the dredge get caught it is the first thing to give way under the
strain, and in doing so it often alters the position of the dredge so
as to allow of its extrication.</p>

<p>The dredge is slipped gently over the side, either from the bow
or from the stern&mdash;in a small boat more usually the latter&mdash;while
there is a little way on, and the direction which the rope
takes indicates roughly whether the dredge is going down
properly. When it reaches the ground and begins to scrape, an
experienced hand upon the rope can usually detect at once a
tremor given to the dredge by the scraper passing over the
irregularities of the bottom. The due amount of rope is then
paid out, and the rope hitched to a bench or rowlock-pin. The
boat should move very slowly, probably not faster than a mile an
hour. In still water or with a very slight current the dredge of
course anchors the boat, and oars or sails are necessary; but if
the boat be moving at all it is all that is required. It is perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page570" id="page570"></a>570</span>
most pleasant to dredge with a close-reefed sail before a light
wind, with weights, against a very slight tide or current; but
these are conditions which cannot be commanded. The dredge
may remain down from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes,
by which time, if things go well, it ought to be fairly filled. In
dredging from a small boat the simplest plan is for two or three
men to haul in, hand over hand, and coil in the bottom of the
boat. For a large yawl or yacht, and for depths over 50 fathoms,
a winch is a great assistance. The rope takes a couple of turns
round the winch, which is worked by two men, while a third hand
takes it from the winch and coils it down.</p>

<p>It is easier to operate a dredge from a steam vessel than a
sailing boat, but if the steamer is of any size great care should be
taken that the dredge does not move too rapidly.</p>

<p>Two ingenious cases of dredging under unusual conditions are
worthy of mention, one case from shore, one from ice. In the
Trondligem Fjord, Canon A. M. Norman in 1890 worked by
hauling the dredge up the precipitous shores of the fjord. The
dredge was shot from a boat close to the shore, to which after
paying out some hundreds of fathoms of line it returned. The
dredge was then hauled from the top of the cliffs up whose side it
scraped. Hitches against projecting rocks were frequent and
were overcome by suddenly paying out line for a time. The
dredge was lifted into a boat when it reached the surface of the
sea. The other case occurred during the Antarctic expedition of
the &ldquo;Discovery.&rdquo; Hodgson dropped loops of line along cracks
which occasionally formed in the ice. The ice always joined up
again, but with the line below it; and a hole being cleared at
each place at which the end of the line emerged, the dredge could
be worked between them.</p>

<p>The dredge comes up variously freighted according to the
locality, and the next step is to examine its contents and to store
the objects of search for future use. In a regularly organized
dredging expedition a frame or platform is often erected with a
ledge round it to receive the contents of the dredge, but it does
well enough to capsize it on an old piece of tarpaulin. There
are two ways of emptying the dredge; we may either turn it up
and pour out its contents by the mouth, or we may have a
contrivance by which the bottom of the bag is made to unlace.
The first plan is the simpler and the one more usually adopted;
the second has the advantage of letting the mass slide out more
smoothly and easily, but the lacing introduces rather a damaging
complication, as it is apt to loosen or give way. Any objects
visible on the surface of the heap are now carefully removed, and
placed for identification in jars or tubs of sea-water, of which
there should be a number secured in some form of bottle basket,
standing ready. The heap should not be much disturbed, for the
delicate objects contained in it have already been unavoidably
subjected to a good deal of rough usage, and the less friction
among the stones the better.</p>

<p><i>Examination of the Catch. Sifting.</i>&mdash;The sorting of the catch
is facilitated by sifting. The sieves used in early English expeditions
were of various sizes and meshes, each sieve having a finer
mesh than the sieve smaller than itself. In use the whole were
put together in the form of a nest, the smallest one with the
coarsest mesh being on top. A little of the dredge&rsquo;s contents
were then put in the top sieve, and the whole set moved gently up
and down in a tub of sea water by handles attached to the bottom
one. Objects of different sizes are thus left in different sieves.
A simple but effective plan is to let the sieves of various sized
mesh fit accurately on each other like lids, the coarsest on top,
and to pour water upon material placed on the top one. In the
United States Bureau of Fisheries ship &ldquo;Albatross&rdquo; these
sieves are raised to form a table and the water is led on them
from a hose: the very finest objects or sediments are retained by
the waste water escaping from a catchment tub by muslin bags
let into its sides. Any of these methods are preferable to sifting
by the agitation of a sieve hung over the side, as in the last
anything passing through the sieve is gone past recall.</p>

<p><i>Preservation of Specimens.</i>&mdash;The preservation of specimens
will of course depend on the purpose for which they are intended.
For microscopic observation formaldehyde has some advantages.
It can be stored in 40% solution and used in 2%, thus saving
space, and it preserves many animals in their colours for a time:
formalin preparations do not, however, last as well as do those in
spirit. The suitable fluids for various histological inquiries are
beyond the scope of the present article; but for general marine
histology Bles&rsquo; fluid is useful, being simple to prepare and not
necessitating the removal of the specimen to another fluid. It is
composed of 70% alcohol 90 parts, glacial acetic acid 7 parts,
4% formaldehyde 7 parts.</p>

<p>The scientific value of a dredging depends mainly upon two
things, the care with which the objects procured are preserved and
labelled for future identification and reference, and the accuracy
with which all the circumstances of the dredging&mdash;the position,
the depth, the nature of the ground, the date, the bottom-temperature,
&amp;c.&mdash;are recorded. In the British Marine Biological
Association&rsquo;s work in the North Sea, a separate sheet of a printed
book with carbon paper and duplicate sheets (which remain
always on the ship) is used for the record of the particulars of
each haul; depth, gear, &amp;c., being filled into spaces indicated in
the form. This use of previously prepared forms has been found
to be a great saving of time and avoids risk of omission. Whether
labelled externally or not, all bottles should contain parchment
or good paper labels written with a soft pencil. These cannot
be lost. The more fully details of reference number of station,
gear, date, &amp;c., are given the better, as should a mistake be made
in one particular it can frequently be traced and rectified by
means of the rest.</p>

<p><i>Growth of Scope of Operations.</i>&mdash;At the Birmingham meeting
of the British Association in 1839 an important committee was
appointed &ldquo;for researches with the dredge with a view to the
investigation of the marine zoology of Great Britain, the <span class="correction" title="amended from illlustration">illustration</span>
of the geographical distribution of marine animals, and the
more accurate determination of the fossils of the Pliocene period.&rdquo;
Of this committee Edward Forbes was the ruling spirit, and
under the genial influence of his contagious enthusiasm great
progress was made during the next decade in the knowledge
of the fauna of the British seas, and many wonderfully pleasant
days were spent by the original committee and by many others
who from year to year were &ldquo;added to their number.&rdquo; Every
annual report of the British Association contains communications
from the English, the Scottish, or the Irish branches of the
committee; and in 1850 Edward Forbes submitted its first
general report on British marine zoology. This report, as might
have been anticipated from the eminent qualifications of the
reporter, was of the highest value; and, taken along with his
remarkable memoirs previously published, &ldquo;On the Distribution
of the Mollusca and Radiata of the Aegean Sea,&rdquo; and &ldquo;On the
Zoological Relations of the existing Fauna and Flora of the
British Isles,&rdquo; may be said to mark an era in the progress of
human thought.</p>

<p>The dredging operations of the British Association committee
were carried on generally under the idea that at the 100-fathom
line, by which amateur work in small boats was practically
limited, the zero of animal life was approached&mdash;a notion which
was destined to be gradually undermined, and finally overthrown.
From time to time, however, there were not wanting
men of great skill and experience to maintain, with Sir James
Clark Ross, that &ldquo;from however great a depth we may be
enabled to bring up mud and stones of the bed of the ocean we
shall find them teeming with animal life.&rdquo; Samples of the sea-bottom
procured with great difficulty and in small quantity
from the first deep soundings in the Atlantic, chiefly by the use
of Brooke&rsquo;s sounding machine, an instrument which by a neat
contrivance disengaged its weights when it reached the bottom,
and thus allowed a tube, so arranged as to get filled with a sample
of the bottom, to be recovered by the sounding line, were eagerly
examined by microscopists; and the singular fact was established
that these samples consisted over a large part of the bed of the
Atlantic of the entire or broken shells of certain foraminifera.
Dr Wallich, the naturalist to the &ldquo;Bulldog&rdquo; sounding expedition
under Sir Leopold M&rsquo;Clintock, reported that star-fishes,
with their stomachs full of the deep-sea foraminifera, had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page571" id="page571"></a>571</span>
up from a depth of 1200 fathoms on a sounding line; and doubts
began to be entertained whether the bottom of the sea was in
truth a desert, or whether it might not present a new zoological
region open to investigation and discovery, and peopled by a
peculiar fauna suited to its special conditions.</p>

<p>In the year 1867, while the question was still undecided,
two testing investigations were undertaken independently. In
America Count L. F. de Pourtales (1824-1880), an officer employed
in the United States Coast Survey under Benjamin Peirce,
commenced a series of deep dredgings across the Gulf Stream off
the coast of Florida, which were continued in the following year,
and were productive of most valuable results; and in Great
Britain the Admiralty, on the representation of the Royal Society,
placed the &ldquo;Lightning,&rdquo; a small gun-vessel, at the disposal of a
small committee to sound and dredge in the North Atlantic
between Shetland and the Faröe Islands.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Lightning,&rdquo; with the help of a donkey-engine
for winding in, dredging was carried on with comparative ease
at a depth of 600 fathoms, and at that depth animal life was
found to be still abundant. The results of the &ldquo;Lightning&rsquo;s&rdquo;
dredgings were regarded of so great importance to science that
the Royal Society pressed upon the Admiralty the advantage
of continuing the researches, and accordingly, during the years
1869 and 1870, the gun-boat &ldquo;Porcupine&rdquo; was put under the
orders of a committee consisting of Dr W. B. Carpenter, Dr
Gwyn Jeffreys, and Professor (afterwards Sir Charles) Wyville
Thomson, one or other of whom superintended the scientific work
of a series of dredging trips in the North Atlantic to the north
and west of the British Islands, which occupied two summers.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Porcupine,&rdquo; in the summer of 1869, dredging was
carried down successfully to a depth of 2435 fathoms, upwards
of two miles and a half, in the Bay of Biscay, and the dredge
brought up well-developed representatives of all the classes of
marine invertebrates. During the cruises of the &ldquo;Porcupine&rdquo;
the fauna of the deep water off the western coasts of Great
Britain and of Spain and Portugal was tolerably well ascertained,
and it was found to differ greatly from the fauna of shallow
water in the same region, to possess very special characters, and
to show a very marked relation to the faunae of the earlier
Tertiary and the later Cretaceous periods.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1872, as a sequel to the preliminary cruises
of the &ldquo;Lightning&rdquo; and &ldquo;Porcupine,&rdquo; by far the most considerable
expedition in which systematic dredging had ever been
made a special object left Great Britain. H.M.S. &ldquo;Challenger,&rdquo;
a corvette of 2306 tons, with auxiliary steam working to 1234
h.p., was despatched to investigate the physical and biological
conditions of the great ocean basins.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; was provided with a most complete and
liberal organization for the purpose; she had powerful deck
engines for hauling in the dredge, workrooms, laboratories and
libraries for investigating the results on the spot, and a staff of
competent naturalists to undertake such investigations and to
superintend the packing and preservation of the specimens
reserved for future study. Since the &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; expedition
the use of wire rope has enabled far smaller vessels to undertake
deep sea work. The &ldquo;Challenger,&rdquo; however, may be said to have
established the practicability of dredging at any known depth.</p>

<p><i>Operating Dredges and Trawls in deep Seas.</i>&mdash;Dredging operations
from large vessels in deep seas present numerous difficulties.
The great weight of the ship makes her motion, whether
of progress or rolling, irresistible to the dredge. The
latter tends to jump, therefore, which both lowers its
efficiency and causes it to exert a sudden strain on
the dredge rope.</p>

<p>The efficiency or evenness of dredging was secured,
therefore, by the special device of fastening a heavy
weight some 200 or 300 fathoms from the dredge end
of the dredge rope. This was either lowered with the
dredge or sent down after by means of a &ldquo;messenger,&rdquo;
a ring of rope fixed round, but running freely on, the
dredge rope. The latter plan was used on the &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo;;
the weights were six 28 &#8468; leads in canvas
covers: their descent was arrested by a toggle or wooden cross-bar
previously attached to the rope at the desired point. When, however,
the rope used is of wire this front weight is unnecessary.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The possibility of sudden strain necessitates a constant watching
of the dredge rope, as the ship&rsquo;s engines may at any moment be
needed to ease the tension by stopping the vessel&rsquo;s way, and the
hauling engines by paying out more rope. The use of accumulators
both renders the strain more gradual and gives warning of an
increase or decrease; indeed they can be calibrated and used as
dynamometers to measure the strain. One of the best forms of
accumulator consists of a pile of perforated rubber disks, which
receive the strain and become compressed in doing so. The arrangement
is in essence as follows. The disks form a column resting on
a cross-bar or base, from which two rods pass up one on each side of
the column. Another cross-bar rests on the top disk, and from it a
rod passes freely down the centre perforation of disks and base.
Eyes are attached to the lower end of this rod and to a yoke connecting
the side rods at the top: a pull exerted on these eyes is thus
modified by the elasticity of the dredge. In the &ldquo;Porcupine&rdquo; and
other early expeditions the accumulator was hung from the main
yard arm, and the block through which the dredge rope ran suspended
from it. In more recent ships a special derrick boom is
rigged for this block, and a second accumulator is sometimes inserted
between the topping lift by which this is raised and the end of the
boom.</p>

<p>The margin of safety of steel wire rope is much larger than is that
of hempen rope, a fact of importance both in towing in a rough sea
and in hauling. Galvanized steel wire with a hempen core was first
used by Agassiz on the &ldquo;Blake.&rdquo; He states that his wire weighed
one pound per fathom, against two pounds per fathom of hempen
rope, and had a breaking strain nearly twice that of hempen rope,
which bore two tons. Thus in hauling the wire rope has both greater
capability and less actual strain. It has also the advantages of
occupying a mere fraction (<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">9</span>) of the storage space needed for rope,
of lasting much longer, and its vibrations transmit much more rapid
and minute indications of the conduct of the dredge.</p>

<p>Wire rope is kept wound on reels supplied with efficient brakes to
check or stop its progress, and an engine is often fitted for winding
it in and veering it out. From the reel it passes to the drum of the
hauling engine, round which it takes some few turns; care is taken
by watching or by the use of an automatic regulator (Tanner) that
it is taken at a rate equal to that at which it is moving over the side.
From the hauling engine it passes over leading wheels (one of which
should preferably be a registering wheel and indicate the amount of
rope which has passed it), and so it reaches the end of the derrick
boom.</p>
</div>

<p>The dredge is lowered from the derrick boom, which has been
previously trained over to windward so that its end is well clear
of the ship, while the ship is slowly moving forward. The rope
is checked until the net is seen to be towing clear, and then
lowered rapidly. Where a weight is used in front of the trawl
Captain Calver successfully adopted the plan of backing after
sufficient line had been paid out: the part of the rope from
weight to surface thus became more vertical, while the shorter
remainder, previously in line with it, sank to the bottom without
change of relative position of weight and dredge. The ship was
then ready for towing. When no front weight is used the
man&oelig;uvre is unnecessary.</p>

<p>There should be a relation maintained between speed of vessel
onward and of rope downward, or a foul haul may result owing
to the gear capsizing (in the case of a trawl), or getting the net
over the mouth (in a dredge). The most satisfactory method of
ensuring this relation seems to be so to manage the two speeds
that the angle made by the dredge rope is fairly constant. This
angle can be observed with a simple clinometer. The following
table abridged from Tanner most usefully brings together the
requisite angles with other useful quantities.</p>

<p>The speed of towing, always slow, may be assumed to be approximately
correct if the appropriate angle is maintained. Hauling
should at first be slow from great depths, but may increase in
speed as the gear rises.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>For further details of deep-sea dredging, especially of the hauling
machinery and management of the gear, the special reports of the
various expeditions must be consulted. Commander Tanner, U.S.N.,
has given in <i>Deep Sea Exploration</i> (1897) a very full and good account
of the equipment of an exploring ship; and to this book the present
article is much indebted.</p>

Dredge, with Tangle Bar.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Modifications and Additions to the Dredge.</i>&mdash;From 1818, when
Sir John Ross brought up a fine Astrophyton from over 800
fathoms on a sounding line in Baffin&rsquo;s Bay, instances gradually
accumulated of specimens being obtained from great depths
without nets or traps. The naturalists of the &ldquo;Porcupine&rdquo;
and other expeditions found that echinoderms, corals and sponges
were often carried up adhering to the outer surface of the dredge
and the last few fathoms of dredge rope. In order to increase
the effectiveness of this method of capture a bar was fastened
to the bottom of the dredge, to which bunches of teased-out
hemp were tied. In this way specimens of the greatest interest,
and frequently of equal importance with those in the dredge
bag, were obtained. The tangle bar
was at first attached to the back of the
net. From the &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; expedition
onward it has been fixed behind the
net by iron bars stretching back from
the short sides of the dredge frame
which pass through eyes in their first
ends (fig. 15). The swabs are thus
unable to fold over the mouth of the
dredge. Rope lashings to the lips of
the dredge are sometimes added, and a
weight is tied to the larger bar to keep
it down.</p>

<p>Occasionally the tangle bar is used
alone (Agassiz), and one form (Tanner)
has two bars, stretching back like the
side strokes of the letter A from a strong
steel spring in the form of an almost
complete circle. The whole is pulled
forward from a spherical sinker fastened
in front of the spring apex; and should
the apex enter a crevice between rock
masses, the side bars are closed by the
pressure instead of catching and bringing up. This is said to
be a very useful instrument among corals.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>The Blake Dredge.</i>&mdash;In the soft ooze which forms the bottom of
deep seas the common dredge sinks and digs much too deeply for its
ordinary purpose, owing partly to its chief weight bearing on the frame
only, partly to its everted lips. To obviate these defects Lieutenant
Commander Sigsbee of the &ldquo;Blake&rdquo; devised the Blake dredge. Its
novel features were the frame and lips. The former was in the form
of a skeleton box; that is, a rectangle of iron bars was placed at the
back as well as the front or mouth of the net and four more iron bars
connected the two rectangles. The lips instead of being everted
were in parallel planes&mdash;those, namely, of the top and bottom of the
net. The effect of this was to minimize digging and somewhat
spread the incidences of the weight. Another advantage was that
the net being constantly distended by its frame, and, moreover,
protected top and bottom by an external shield of canvas, quite
delicate specimens reached the surface uninjured. The dredge
weighed 80 &#8468; and was 4 ft. square and 9 in. deep.</p>

<p><i>Rake Dredges.</i>&mdash;These are devices for collecting burrowing
creatures without filling the dredge with the soil in which they live.
Holt used, at Plymouth, a dredge whose side bars and lower lip were
of iron, the latter armed with forward and downward pointing teeth
which stirred up the sand and its denizens in front of the dredge
mouth. The upper lip of the dredge was replaced by a bar of wood.
The bag was of cheese-cloth or light open canvas, and the whole was
of light construction. The apparatus was very useful in capturing
small burrowing crustacea. The Chester rake dredge is a Blake
dredge in front of which is secured a heavy iron rectangle with teeth
placed almost at right angles to its long sides and in the plane of the
rectangle. Each of these instruments has a width along the scraping
edge of about 3 ft.</p>

<tr><td class="caption1"><span class="sc">Fig. 16.</span>&mdash;Conical Dredge being hoisted in.</td></tr></table>

<p><i>Triangular and Conical Dredges.</i>&mdash;Two other dredges are worthy
of mention. The triangular dredge, much resembling Müller&rsquo;s but
with a triangular mouth, and hung by chains from its angles, is an
old fashion now not in general use. It is, however, very useful for
rocky ground. At the Plymouth marine laboratory was also devised
the conical dredge (1901), the circular form being the suggestion of
Garstang. This dredge (fig. 16) was intended for digging deeply.
It is of wrought iron, and of the following dimensions: diameter of
mouth 16 in., length
33 in., depth of ring
at mouth 9 in. Its
weight is 67 &#8468;. As
at first used the
spaces between the
bars are closed by
wire netting; if used
for collecting bottom
samples it is furnished
with a lining
of strong sail-cloth.</p>

<p>Its weight and the
small length of edge
in contact with the
ground cause this
dredge to dig well,
and enable the user
to obtain many
objects which though
quite common are of
rare occurrence in an
ordinary dredge.
Thus on the Brown
Ridges, a fishing-ground
west of Holland,
although <i>Donax
vittalus</i> is known
from examination of
fish stomachs to be
abundant, it is rarely
taken except in the
conical dredge: the
same is true of <i>Echinocyamus
pusillus</i>,
which is in many
parts of the North
Sea abundant in bottom samples and in no ordinary dredgings.
With the sail-cloth lining the conical dredge fills in about 10 minutes
on most ground, and no material washing out of fine sediment occurs
on hauling. In shallow seas such as the North Sea commercial
beam and other trawls are now used as quantitative instruments in
the estimation of the fish population, especially of the <i>Pleuronectidae</i>.</p>

<p><i>Use of Small Trawls for Dredging.</i>&mdash;Although these trawls do not
here concern us, certain adaptations of small beam trawls for biological
exploration are of such identical use with the dredge, and
differ from it so little in structure and size, that they may be here
described.</p>

<p>A small beam trawl was first used from the &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; (fig. 17).
It was sent down in 600 fathoms off Cape St Vincent, the reason for
its use being the frequency with which the dredge sank into the sea-bottom
and there remained until hauling. The experiment was
entirely successful. The sinking of the net was avoided, the net
had a much greater spread than the dredge, and in addition to
invertebrates it captured several fish. After this the trawl was
frequently used instead of the dredge. Indeed tangle bar, dredge
and trawl form a series which are fitted
for use on the roughest, moderately rough
and fairly firm, and the softest ground
respectively, although the dredge can be
used almost anywhere.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 220px;" summary="Illustration">

<tr><td class="caption1"><span class="f80">From Sir Charles Wyville
Thomson&rsquo;s <i>Voyage of the

<span class="sc">Fig. 17.</span>&mdash;Trawl of the
&ldquo;Challenger.&rdquo;</td></tr></table>

<p>The frame of the &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; trawl consisted
of a 15 ft. wooden beam which in use
was drawn over the sea-bed on two runners
resembling those of a sledge, by means of
two ropes or bridles attached to eyes in the
front of the runners or &ldquo;trawl heads.&rdquo; A
net 30 ft. long was suspended by one side
to the beam by half-a-dozen stops. The
remainder of the net&rsquo;s mouth was of much
greater length than the beam, and was
weighted with close-set rolls of sheet lead;
it thus dragged along the bottom in a curve
approximately to a semicircle, behind the
beam. The net tapers towards the hinder
end, and contains a second net with open
bottom, which, reaching about three-quarters
of the way down the main net, acts as a
valve or pocket. Both heels (or hinder ends) of the trawl heads and
the tail of the net were weighted to assist the net in digging sufficiently
and to maintain its balance&mdash;an important point, since if the
trawl lands on its beam the net&rsquo;s mouth remains closed, and nothing
is caught.</p>

<p>The main differences of this trawl from the dredge are the replacement
of scraping lip by ground rope, the position of this ground rope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page573" id="page573"></a>573</span>
and the greater size of the mouth. The absence of a lip makes it
less effective for burrowing and sessile creatures, but the weighted
ground rope nevertheless secures them to a very surprising extent.
The position of the ground rope is an important feature, as any free
swimming creature not disturbed until the arrival of the ground
rope cannot escape by simply rising or &ldquo;striking&rdquo; up. This and
the greater spread make the trawl especially suitable for the collection
of fishes and other swiftly moving animals. The first haul of
the &ldquo;Challenger&rdquo; trawl brought up fishes, and most of our knowledge
of fish of the greatest depths is due to it.</p>

<p>A tendency to return to the use of the small beam trawl for deep-sea
work has lately shown itself. That used by Tanner on the
&ldquo;Albatross&rdquo; has runners more heart-shaped than the &ldquo;Challenger&rsquo;s&rdquo;
instrument; the net is fastened to the downward and backward
sloping edge of the runner as well as to the beam, being thus fixed
on three sides instead of one; and a Norwegian glass float is fastened
in a network cover to that part of the net which is above and in front
of the ground rope in use, to assist in keeping the opening clear.
These floats can stand the pressure at great
depths, and do not become waterlogged as do
cork floats. The largest &ldquo;Albatross&rdquo; trawl has
a beam 11 ft. long, runners 2 ft. 5 in. high, and
its frame weighs 275 &#8468;.</p>

<p><i>Agassiz or Blake Trawl.</i>&mdash;This is generally
considered to possess advantages over the preceding,
and is decidedly better for those not
experts in trawling. Its frame (fig. 18) consists
of two iron runners each the shape of a capital
letter D, joined by iron rods or pipes which
connect the middle of each stroke with the
corresponding point on the other letter. The
net is a tapering one, its mouth being a strong
rope bound with finer rope for protection till
the whole reaches a thickness of some 2 in. It
is fastened to the frame at four points only, the
ends of the curved rods, and thus has a rectangular
opening.</p>

<p>The chief advantage of this frame is that it
does not matter in the least which side lands
first on the bottom; it is to the other trawls
what Ball&rsquo;s dredge is to an oyster dredge. The
course can also be altered during shooting or
towing the Blake trawl with far greater ease
than is the case with others. An Agassiz trawl very successful
in the North Sea has the following dimensions: length of the connecting
rods and therefore of the mouth 8 ft., height of runners and
of mouth 1 ft. 9 in., extreme length of runners 2 ft., length of net
11 ft. 3 in., weight of whole trawl 94 &#8468;, 63 of which are due to the
frame.</p>
</div>

<p>It is instructive to note how closely our knowledge of bottom-living
forms has been associated with the instruments of capture
in use. As long as small vessels were used in dredging, the belief
that life was limited to the regions accessible to them was widely
spread. The first known denizens of great depths were the
foraminifera and few echinoderms brought up by various sounding
apparatus. Next with the dredge and tangles the number
of groups obtained was much greater. As soon as trawls were
adopted fish began to make their appearance. The greatest gaps
in our knowledge still probably occur in the large and swiftly
moving forms, such as fish and cephalopods. As we can hardly
hope to move apparatus swiftly over the bottom in great depths,
the way in which improvement is possible probably is that of
increasing the spread of the nets; and a start in this direction
appears to have been made by Dr Petersen, who has devised a
modified otter sieve which catches fish at all events very well,
and has been operated already at considerable depths.</p>

<p>Of the economy of quite shallow seas, however, we are still
largely ignorant. Much as has been learnt of the bionomics
of the sea, it is but a commencement; and this is of course
especially true of deep seas. The dredge and its kindred have,
however, in less than a century enabled naturalists to compile an
immense mass of knowledge of the structure, development,
affinities and distribution of the animals of the sea-bed, and in
the most accessible seas to produce enumerations and morphological
accounts of them of some approach to completeness.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRELINCOURT, CHARLES<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (1595-1669), French Protestant
divine, was born at Sedan on the 10th of July 1595. In 1618
he undertook the charge of the French Protestant church at
Langres, but failed to receive the necessary royal sanction, and
early in 1620 he removed to Paris, where he was nominated
minister of the Reformed Church at Charenton. He was the
author of a large number of works in devotional and polemical
theology, several of which had great influence. His <i>Catechism</i>
(<i>Catéchisme ou instruction familière</i>, 1652) and his <i>Christian&rsquo;s
Defense against the Fears of Death</i> (<i>Consolations de l&rsquo;âme fidèle
contre les frayeurs de la mort, 1651</i>) became well known in England
by means of translations, which were very frequently reprinted.
It has been said that Daniel Defoe wrote his fiction of Mrs Veal
(<i>A True Relation of the Apparition of Mrs Veal</i>), who came from
the other world to recommend the perusal of <i>Drelincourt on
Death</i>, for the express purpose of promoting the sale of an English
translation of the <i>Consolations</i>; Defoe&rsquo;s contribution is added
to the fourth edition of the translation (1706). Another popular
work of his was <i>Les Visites charitables pour toutes sortes de
personnes affligées</i> (1669). Drelincourt&rsquo;s controversial works were
numerous. Directed entirely against Roman Catholicism, they
did much to strengthen and consolidate the Protestant party in
France. He died on the 3rd of November 1669.</p>

<p>Several of his sons were distinguished as theologians or
physicians. Laurent (1626-1681) became a pastor, and was the
author of <i>Sonnets chrétiens sur divers sujets</i> (1677); Charles
(1633-1697) was professor of physic at the university of Leiden,
and physician to the prince of Orange; Peter (1644-1722) was
ordained a priest in the Church of England, and became dean of
Armagh.</p>

pop. (1900) 149,551. The province of Drente is a sandy plateau
forming the kernel of the surrounding provinces. The soil
consists almost entirely of sand and gravel, and is covered with
bleak moorland, patches of wood, and fen. This is only varied
by the strip of fertile clay and grass-land which is found along
the banks of the rivers, and by the areas of high fen in the south-eastern
corner and on the western borders near Assen. The
surface of the province is a gentle slope from the south-west
towards the north-east, where it terminates in the long ridge of
hills known as the Hondsrug (Dog&rsquo;s Back) extending along the
eastern border into Groningen. The watershed of the province
runs from east to west across the middle of the province, along
the line of the Orange canal. The southern streams are all
collected at two points on the southern borders, namely, at
Meppel and Koevorden, whence they communicate with the
Zwarte Water and the Vecht respectively by means of the
Meppeler Diep and the Koevorden canal. The Steenwyker Aa,
however, enters the Zuider Zee independently. The northern
rivers all flow into Groningen. The piles of granite rocks somewhat
in the shape of cromlechs which are found scattered about
this province, and especially along the western edge of the
Hondsrug, have long been named <i>Hunebedden</i>, from a popular
superstition that they were &ldquo;Huns&rsquo; beds.&rdquo; Possibly the word
originally meant &ldquo;beds of the dead,&rdquo; or tombs.</p>

<p>Two industries have for centuries been associated with the
barren heaths and sodden fens so usually found together on the
sand-grounds, namely, the cultivation of buckwheat and peat-digging.
The work is conducted on a regular system of fen
colonization, the first operation being directed towards the
drainage of the country. This is effected by means of drainage
canals cut at regular intervals and connected by means of cross
ditches. These draining ditches all have their issue in a main
drainage canal, along which the transport of the peat and peat-litter
takes place and the houses of the colonists are built. The
heathlands when sufficiently drained are prepared for cultivation
by being cut into sods and burnt. This system appears to have
been practised already at the end of the 17th century. After
eight years, however, the soil becomes exhausted, and twenty
to thirty years are required for its refertilization. The cultivation
of buckwheat on these grounds has decreased, and large
areas which were formerly thus treated now lie waste. Potatoes,
rye, oats, beans and peas are also largely cultivated. In connexion
with the cultivation of potatoes, factories are established
for making spirits, treacle, potato-meal, and straw-paper.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page574" id="page574"></a>574</span>
Furthermore, agriculture is everywhere accompanied on the
sand-grounds by the rearing of sheep and cattle, which assist
in fertilizing the soil. Owing to the meagreness of their food these
animals are usually thin and small, but are quickly restored
when placed on richer grounds. The breeding of pigs is also
widely practised on the sand-grounds, as well as forest culture.
Of the fen-colonies in Drente the best known are those of
Frederiksoord and Veenhuizen.</p>

<p>Owing to the general condition of poverty which prevailed
after the French evacuation in the second decade of the 19th
century, attention was turned to the means of industry offered
by the unreclaimed heath-lands in the eastern provinces, and
in 1818 the Society of Charity (<i>Maatschappij van <span class="correction" title="amended from Weldadigkeid">Weldadigheid</span></i>)
was formed with Count van den Bosch at its head. This society
began by establishing the free agricultural colony of Frederiksoord,
about 10 m. N. of Meppel, named after Prince Frederick,
son of William I., king of the Netherlands. An industrious
colonist could purchase a small farm on the estate and make himself
independent in two years. In addition to this, various industries
were set on foot for the benefit of those who were not
capable of field work, such as mat and rope making, and jute and
cotton weaving. In later times forest culture was added, and the
Gerard Adriaan van Swieten schools of forestry, agriculture and
horticulture were established by Major van <span class="correction" title="amended from Sweiten">Swieten</span> in memory
of his son. A Reformed and a Roman Catholic church are also
attached to the colony. To this colony the Society of Charity
later added the adjoining colonies of Willemsoord and Kolonie
VII. in Overysel, and Wilhelminasoord partly in Friesland.
The colony of Veenhuizen lies about 7 m. N.W. of Assen, and
was founded by the same society in 1823. In 1859, however,
the Veenhuizen estates were sold to the government for the
purpose of a penal establishment for drunkards and beggars.</p>

<p>Owing to its geographical isolation, the development of Drente
has remained behind that of every other province in the Netherlands,
and there are few centres of any importance, either
agricultural or industrial. Hence the character and customs of
the people have remained peculiarly conservative. Assen is the
chief town. In the south Meppel and Koevorden absorb the
largest amount of trade. Hoogeveen, situated between these
two, owes its origin to the fen reclamation which was begun here
in 1625 by Baron van Echten. In the following year it was
erected into a barony which lasted till 1795. The original
industry has long since moved onwards to other parts, but the
town remains a prosperous market centre, and has a considerable
industrial activity. Extensive fir woods have been laid out in
the neighbourhood. Zuidlaren is a picturesque village at the
northern end of the Hondsrug, with an important market. The
railway from Amsterdam to Groningen traverses Drente; branch
lines connect Meppel with Leeuwarden and Assen with Delfzÿl.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The early history of Drente is obscure. That it
was inhabited at a remote date is proved by the prehistoric
sepulchral mounds, the <i>Hunebedden</i> already mentioned. In the
5th and 6th centuries the country was overrun by Saxon tribes,
and later on was governed by counts under the Frankish and
German kings. Of these only three are recorded, Eberhard
(943-944), Balderic (1006) and Temmo (1025). In 1046 the
emperor Henry III. gave the countship to the bishop and chapter
of Utrecht, who governed it through the burgrave, or châtelain,
of Koevorden, a dignity which became hereditary after 1143 in
the family of Ludolf or Roelof, brother of Heribert of Bierum,
bishop of Utrecht (1138-1150). This family became extinct
in the male line about 1232, and was succeeded by Henry I.
of Borculo (1232-1261), who had married the heiress of Roelof III.
of Koevorden. In 1395 Reinald IV. (d. 1410) of Borculo-Koevorden
was deposed by Bishop Frederick of Utrecht, and the
country was henceforth administered by an episcopal official
(<i>amptman</i>), who was, however, generally a native. With its
popularly elected assembly of twenty-four Etten (<i>jurati</i>) Drente
remained practically independent. This state of things continued
till 1522, when it was conquered by Duke Charles of
Gelderland, from whom it was taken by the emperor Charles V.
in 1536, and became part of the Habsburg dominions.</p>

<p>Drente took part in the revolt of the Netherlands, and being
a district covered by waste heath and moor was, on account of
its poverty and sparse population, not admitted into the union
as a separate province, and it had no voice in the assembly of the
states-general. It was subdued by the Spaniards in 1580, but
reconquered by Maurice of Nassau in 1594. During the years
that followed, Drente, though unrepresented in the states-general,
retained its local independence and had its own stadtholder.
William Louis of Nassau-Siegen (d. 1620) held that
office, and it was held later by Maurice, Frederick Henry,
William II. and William III., princes of Orange. At the general
assembly of 1651 Drente put forward its claim to admission as a
province, but was not admitted. After the deaths of William II.
(1650) and of William III. (1702) Drente remained for a term of
years without a stadtholder, but in 1722 William Charles Henry
of the house of Nassau-Siegen, who, through the extinction of
the elder line, had become prince of Orange, was elected stadtholder.
His descendants held that office, which was declared
hereditary, until the French conquest in 1795. In the following
year Drente at length obtained the privilege, which it had long
sought, of being reckoned as an eighth province with representation
in the states-general. Between 1806 and 1813 Drente,
with the rest of the Netherlands, was incorporated in the French
empire, and, with part of Groningen, formed the department
of Ems Occidental. With the accession of William I. as king of
the Netherlands it was restored to its old position as a province
of the new kingdom.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRESDEN<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span>, a city of Germany, capital of the kingdom of
Saxony, 71 m. E.S.E. from Leipzig and 111 m. S. from Berlin
by railway. It lies at an altitude of 402 ft. above the Baltic,
in a broad and pleasant valley on both banks of the Elbe. The
prospect of the city with its cupolas, towers, spires and the copper
green roofs of its palaces, as seen from the distance, is one of
striking beauty. On the left bank of the river are the Altstadt
(old town) with four old suburbs and numerous new suburbs,
and the Friedrichstadt (separated from the Altstadt by a long
railway viaduct); on the right, the Neustadt (new town),
Antonstadt, and the modern military suburb Alberstadt. Five
fine bridges connect the Altstadt and Neustadt. The beautiful
central bridge&mdash;the Alte or Augustusbrücke&mdash;with 16 arches,
built in 1727-1731, and 1420 ft. long, has been demolished (1906)
and replaced by a wider structure. Up-stream are the two
modern Albert and Königin Carola bridges, and, down-stream,
the Marien and the Eisenbahn (railway) bridges. The streets
of the Alstadt are mostly narrow and somewhat gloomy, those
of the Neustadt more spacious and regular.</p>

<p>On account of its delightful situation and the many objects of
interest it contains, Dresden is often called &ldquo;German Florence,&rdquo;
a name first applied to it by the poet Herder. The richness of
its art treasures, the educational advantages it offers, and its
attractive surroundings render it a favourite resort of people
with private means. There are a large number of foreign residents,
notably Austro-Hungarians and Russians, and also a
considerable colony of English and Americans, the latter amounting
to about 1500. The population of the city on the 1st of
December 1905 was 516,996, of whom 358,776 lived on the
left bank (Altstadt) and 158,220 on the right (Neustadt). The
royal house belongs to the Roman Catholic confession, but the
bulk of the inhabitants are Lutheran Protestants.</p>

<p>Dresden is the residence of the king, the seat of government
for the kingdom of Saxony, and the headquarters of the XII.
(Saxon) Army Corps. Within two decades (1880-1900) the capital
almost at a single bound advanced into the front rank of German
commercial and industrial towns; but while gaining in prosperity
it has lost much of its medieval aspect. Old buildings in the
heart of the Altstadt have been swept away, and their place
occupied by modern business houses and new streets. Among
the public squares in the Altstadt must be mentioned the
magnificent Theaterplatz, with a fine equestrian statue of King
John, by Schilling; the Altmarkt, with a monument commemorative
of the war of 1870-71; the Neumarkt, with a
bronze statue of King Frederick Augustus II., by E. J. Hähnel;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page575" id="page575"></a>575</span>
the Postplatz, adorned by a Gothic fountain, by Semper; and
the Bismarckplatz in the Anglo-American quarter. In the
Neustadt are the market square, with a bronze equestrian statue
of Augustus the Strong; the Kaiser Wilhelmplatz; and the
Albertplatz. The continuous Schloss-, See- and Prager-Strasse,
and the Wilsdruffer- and König Johann-Strasse are the main
streets in the Altstadt, and the Hauptstrasse in the Neustadt.</p>

<p>The most imposing churches include the Roman Catholic
Hofkirche, built (1739-1751) by C. Chiaveri, in rococo style, with
a tower 300 ft. high. It contains a fine organ by Silbermann and
pictures by Raphael Mengs and other artists, the outside being
adorned with 59 statues by Mattielli. On the Neumarkt is the
Frauenkirche, with a stone cupola rising to the height of 311 ft.;
close to the Altmarkt, the Kreuzkirche, rebuilt after destruction
by fire in 1897, also with a lofty tower surmounted by a cupola;
and near the Postplatz the Sophienkirche, with twin spires.
In the Neustadt is the Dreikönigskirche (dating from the
18th century) with a high pinnacled tower. Among more
modern churches may be mentioned: in the Altstadt, the
Johanneskirche, with a richly decorated interior; the Lukaskirche;
and the Trinitatiskirche; and in the Neustadt, the
Martin Luther-Kirche and the new garrison church. Apart
from the chapels in the royal palaces, Dresden contains in all 32
churches, viz. 21 Evangelical, 6 Roman Catholic, a Reformed, a
Russian, an English (erected by Gilbert Scott) with a graceful spire,
a Scottish (Presbyterian), and an American (Episcopal) church,
the last a handsome building, with a pretty parsonage attached.</p>

<p>Of secular buildings, the most noteworthy are grouped in the
Altstadt near the river. The royal palace, built in 1530-1535
by Duke George (and thus called Georgenschloss), was thoroughly
restored, and in some measure rebuilt between 1890 and 1902,
in German Renaissance style, and is now an exceedingly handsome
structure. The Georgentor has been widened, and through it,
and beneath the royal apartments, vehicular traffic from the
centre of the town is directed to the Augustusbrücke. The whole
is surmounted by a lofty tower&mdash;387 ft.&mdash;the highest in Dresden.
The interior is splendidly decorated. In the palace chapel are
pictures by Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin, Guido Reni and
Annibale Caracci. The adjoining Prinzen-Palais on the Taschenberg,
built in 1715, has a fine chapel, in which are various works
of S. Torelli; it has also a library of 20,000 volumes. The
Zwinger, begun in 1711, and built in the rococo style, forms an
enclosure, within which is a statue of King Frederick Augustus I.
It was intended to be the vestibule to a palace, but now contains
a number of collections of great value. Until 1846 it was open
at the north side; but this space has since been occupied by
the museum, a beautiful Renaissance building, the exterior of
which is adorned by statues of Michelangelo, Raphael, Giotto,
Dante, Goethe and other artists and poets by Rietschel and
Hähnel, and it contains the famous picture gallery. The Brühl
palace, built in 1737 by Count Brühl, the minister of Augustus II.,
has been in some measure demolished to make room for the new
Ständehaus (diet house), with its main façade facing the Hofkirche;
before the main entrance there is an equestrian statue
(1906) of King Albert. Close by is the Brühl Terrace, approached
by a fine flight of steps, on which are groups, by Schilling,
representing Morning, Evening, Day and Night. The terrace
commands a view of the Elbe and the distant heights of Loschwitz
and the Weisser Hirsch, but the prospect has of late years
become somewhat marred, owing to the extension of the town
up the river and to the two new up-stream bridges. The Japanese
palace in the Neustadt, built in 1715 as a summer residence for
Augustus II., receives its name from certain oriental figures
with which it is decorated; it is sometimes called the Augusteum
and contains the royal library. Among other buildings of note
is the Hoftheatre, a magnificent edifice in the Renaissance
style, built after the designs of Semper, to replace the theatre
burnt in 1869, and completed in 1878. A new town hall of huge
dimensions, also in German Renaissance, with an octagon tower
400 ft. in height, stands on the former southern ramparts of the
inner town, close to the Kreuzkirche. In the Altstadt the most
striking of the newer edifices is the Kunstakademie, constructed
from designs by K. Lipsius in the Italian Renaissance style,
1890-1894. The Albertinum, formerly the arsenal, built in
1559-1563, was rebuilt 1884-1889, and fitted up as a museum
of oriental and classical antiquities, and as the depository of the
state archives. On the right bank of the Elbe in Neustadt stand
the fine buildings of the ministries of war, of finance, justice,
the interior and education. The public monuments of Dresden
also include the Moritz Monument, a relief dedicated by the elector
Augustus to his brother Maurice, a statue of Weber the composer
by Rietschel, a bronze statue of Theodor Körner by Hähnel, the
Rietschel monument on the Brühl Terrace by Schilling, a bust
of Gutzkow, and a statue of Bismarck on the promenade. In
the suburbs which encircle the old town are to be noted the vast
central Hauptbahnhof (1893-1898) occupying the site of the old
Böhmischer railway station, the new premises of the municipal
hospital and the Ausstellungs-Halle (exhibition buildings).</p>

<p>The chief pleasure-ground of Dresden is the Grosser Garten,
in which there are a summer theatre, the Reitschel museum,
and a château containing a museum of antiquities. The
latter is composed chiefly of objects removed from the churches
in consequence of the Reformation. Near the château is the
zoological garden, formed in 1860, and excellently arranged.
A little to the south of Dresden, on the left bank of the Elbe,
is the village Räcknitz, in which is Moreau&rsquo;s monument, erected
on the spot where he was mortally wounded in 1813. The mountains
of Saxon Switzerland are seen from this neighbourhood.</p>

<p><i>Art.</i>&mdash;Dresden owes a large part of its fame to its extensive
artistic, literary and scientific collections. Of these the most
valuable is its splendid picture gallery, founded by Augustus I.
and increased by his successors at great cost. It is in the museum,
and contains about 2500 pictures, being especially rich in specimens
of the Italian, Dutch and Flemish schools. The gem of the
collection is Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;Madonna di San Sisto,&rdquo; for which a room
is set apart. There is also a special room for the &ldquo;Madonna&rdquo;
of the younger Holbein. Other paintings with which the name
of the gallery is generally associated are Correggio&rsquo;s &ldquo;La Notte&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Mary Magdalene&rdquo;; Titian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tribute Money&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Venus&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Adoration&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Marriage in Cana,&rdquo;
by Paul Veronese; Andrea del Sarto&rsquo;s &ldquo;Abraham&rsquo;s Sacrifice&rdquo;;
Rembrandt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Portrait of Himself with his Wife sitting on his
Knee&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Judgment of Paris&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Boar Hunt,&rdquo; by
Rubens; Van Dyck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Charles I., his Queen, and their Children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of modern painters, this magnificent collection contains
masterpieces by Defregger, Vautier, Makart, Munkacsy, Fritz
von Uhde, Böcklin, Hans Thoma; portraits by Leon Pohle,
Delaroche and Sargent; landscapes by Andreas and Oswald
Achenbach and allegorical works by Sascha Schneider. In
separate compartments there are a number of crayon portraits,
most of them by Rosalba Carriera, and views of Dresden by
Canaletto and other artists. Besides the picture gallery the
museum includes a magnificent collection of engravings and
drawings. There are upwards of 400,000 specimens, arranged
in twelve classes, so as to mark the great epochs in the history
of art. A collection of casts, likewise in the museum, is designed
to display the progress of plastic art from the time of the Egyptians
and Assyrians to modern ages. This collection was begun
by Raphael Mengs, who secured casts of the most valuable
antiques in Italy, some of which no longer exist.</p>

<p>The Japanese palace contains a public library of more than
400,000 volumes, with about 3000 MSS. and 20,000 maps. It is
especially rich in the ancient classics, and in works bearing on
literary history and the history of Germany, Poland and France.
There are also a valuable cabinet of coins and a collection of
ancient works of art. A collection of porcelain in the &ldquo;Museum
Johanneum&rdquo; (which once contained the picture gallery) is made
up of specimens of Chinese, Japanese, East Indian, Sèvres and
Meissen manufacture, carefully arranged in chronological order.
There is in the same building an excellent Historical Museum.
In the Grüne Gewölbe (Green Vault) of the Royal Palace, so
called from the character of its original decorations, there is an
unequalled collection of precious stones, pearls and works of art in
gold, silver, amber and ivory. The objects, which are about 3000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page576" id="page576"></a>576</span>
in number, are arranged in eight rooms. They include the regalia
of Augustus II. as king of Poland; the electoral sword of Saxony;
a group by Dinglinger, in gold and enamel, representing the court
of the grand mogul Aurungzebe, and consisting of 132 figures
upon a plate of silver 4 ft. 4 in. square; the largest onyx known,
6<span class="spp">2</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> in. by 2¼ in.; a pearl representing the dwarf of Charles II.
of Spain; and a green brilliant weighing 40 carats. The royal
palace also has a gallery of arms consisting of more than 2000
weapons of artistic or historical value. In the Zwinger are the
zoological and mineralogical museums and a collection of instruments
used in mathematical and physical science. Among other
collections is that of the Körner museum with numerous
reminiscences of the Goethe-Schiller epoch, and of the wars of
liberation (1813-15), and containing valuable manuscripts and
relics. Founded by Hofrath Dr Emil Peschel, it has passed into
the possession of the city.</p>

<p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;Dresden is the seat of a number of well-known
scientific associations. The educational institutions are numerous
and of a high order, including a technical high school (with about
1100 students), which enjoys the privilege of conferring the
degrees of doctor of engineering, doctor of technical sciences,
&amp;c., a veterinary college, a political-economic institution
(Gehestiftung), with library, a school of architects, a royal and
four municipal gymnasia, numerous lower grade and popular
schools, the royal conservatorium for music and drama, and a
celebrated academy of painting. Dresden has several important
hospitals, asylums and other charitable institutions.</p>

<p><i>Music and the Theatres.</i>&mdash;Besides the two royal theatres,
Dresden possesses several minor theatres and music halls. The
pride of place in the world of music is held by the orchestra
attached to the court theatre. Founded by Augustus II., it has
become famous throughout the world, owing to the masters who
have from time to time been associated with it&mdash;such as Paër,
Weber, Reissiger and Wagner. Symphony and popular concerts
are held throughout the year in various public halls, and, during
the winter, concerts of church music are frequently given in the
Protestant Kreuz- and Frauen-Kirchen, and on Sundays in the
Roman Catholic church.</p>

<p><i>Communications and Industries.</i>&mdash;Dresden lies at the centre of
an extensive railway system, which places it in communication
with the chief cities of northern and central Germany as well as
with Austria and the East. Here cross the grand trunk lines
Berlin-Vienna, Chemnitz-Görlitz-Breslau. It is connected by
two lines of railway with Leipzig and by local lines with neighbouring
smaller towns. The navigation on the Elbe has of recent
years largely developed, and, in addition to trade by river with
Bohemia and Magdeburg-Hamburg, there is a considerable
pleasure-boat traffic during the summer months. The communications
within the city are maintained by an excellent
system of electric trams, which bring the more distant suburbs
into easy connexion with the business centre. A considerable
business is done on the exchange, chiefly in local industrial
shares, and the financial institutions number some fifty banks,
among them branches of the Reichs Bank and of the Deutsche
Bank. Among the more notable industries may be mentioned
the manufacture of china (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ceramics</a></span>), of gold and silver
ornaments, cigarettes, chocolate, coloured postcards, perfumery,
straw-plaiting, artificial flowers, agricultural machinery, paper,
photographic and other scientific instruments. There are several
great breweries; corn trade is carried on, and an extensive business
is done in books and objects of art.</p>

<p><i>Surroundings.</i>&mdash;The environs of the city are delightful. To
the north are the vine-clad hills of the Lössnitz commanding
views of the valley of the Elbe from Dresden to Meissen; behind
them, on an island in a lake, is the castle of Moritzburg, the
hunting box of the king of Saxony. On the right bank of the
Elbe, 3 m. above the city, lies the village of Loschwitz, where
Schiller, in the summer of 1786, wrote the greater part of his
<i>Don Carlos</i>: above it on the fringe of the Dresdner Heide, the
climatic health resort Weisser-Hirsch; farther up the river
towards Pirna the royal summer palace Pillnitz; to the south
the Plauensche Grund, and still farther the Rabenauer Grund.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Dresden (Old Slav <i>Drezga</i>, forest, <i>Drezgajan</i>, forest-dwellers),
which is known to have existed in 1206, is of Slavonic
origin, and was originally founded on the right bank of the Elbe,
on the site of the present Neustadt, which is thus actually the <i>old</i>
town. It became the capital of Henry the Illustrious, margrave
of Meissen, in 1270, but belonged for some time after his death,
first to Wenceslaus of Bohemia, and next to the margrave of
Brandenburg. Early in the 14th century it was restored to the
margrave of Meissen. On the division of Saxony in 1485 it
fell to the Albertine line, which has since held it. Having been
burned almost to the ground in 1491, it was rebuilt; and in the
16th century the fortifications were begun and gradually extended.
John George II., in the 17th century, formed the Grosser Garten,
and otherwise greatly improved the town; but it was in the first
half of the 18th century, under Augustus I. and Augustus II., who
were kings of Poland as well as electors of Saxony, that Dresden
assumed something like its present appearance. The Neustadt,
which had been burned down in the 17th century, was founded
anew by Augustus I.; he also founded Friedrichstadt. The town
suffered severely during the Seven Years&rsquo; War, being bombarded
in 1760. Some damage was also inflicted on it in 1813, when
Napoleon made it the centre of his operations; one of the buttresses
and two arches of the old bridge were then blown up. The dismantling
of the fortifications had been begun by the French in
1810, and was gradually completed after 1817, the space occupied
by them being appropriated to gardens and promenades. Many
buildings were completed or founded by King Anthony, from
whom Antonstadt derives its name. Dresden again suffered
severely during the revolution of 1849, but all traces of the
disturbances which then took place were soon effaced. In 1866 it
was occupied by the Prussians, who did not finally evacuate it
until the spring of the following year. Since that time numerous
improvements have been carried out.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Battle of Dresden.</span> The battle of Dresden, the last of the
great victories of Napoleon, was fought on the 26th and 27th
of August 1813. The intervention of Austria in the War of
Liberation, and the consequent advance of the Allies under the
Austrian field-marshal Prince Schwarzenberg from Prague upon
Dresden, recalled Napoleon from Silesia, where he was engaged
against the Prussians and Russians under Blücher. Only by a
narrow margin of time, indeed, was he able to bring back sufficient
troops for the first day&rsquo;s battle. He detached a column under
Vandamme to the mountains to interpose between Schwarzenberg
and Prague (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Napoleonic Campaigns</a></span>); the rest of the
army pressed on by forced marches for Dresden, around which
a position for the whole army had been chosen and fortified,
though at the moment this was held by less than 20,000 men
under Gouvion St Cyr, who retired thither from the mountains,
leaving a garrison in Königstein, and had repeatedly sent reports
to the emperor as to the allied masses gathering to the southward.
The battle of the first day began late in the afternoon,
for Schwarzenberg waited as long as possible for the corps of
Klenau, which formed his extreme left wing on the Freiberg
road. At last, about 6 p.m. he decided to wait no longer, and
six heavy columns of attack advanced against the suburbs
defended by St Cyr and now also by the leading troops of the
main army. Three hundred guns covered the assault, and
Dresden was set on fire in places by the cannonade, while the
French columns marched unceasingly over the bridges and
through the Altstadt. On the right the Russians under Wittgenstein
advanced from Striesen, the Prussians under Kleist through
the Grosser Garten, whilst Prussians under Prince Augustus and
Austrians under Colloredo moved upon the Moczinski redoubt,
which was the scene of the most desperate fighting, and was
repeatedly taken and retaken. The attack to the westward was
carried out by the other Austrian corps; Klenau, however, was
still far distant. In the end, the French defences remained
unshaken. Ney led a counter-attack against the Allies&rsquo; left,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page577" id="page577"></a>577</span>
the Moczinski redoubt was definitely recaptured from Colloredo,
and the Prussians were driven out of the Grosser Garten. The
<i>coup</i> of the Allies had failed, for every hour saw the arrival of
fresh forces on the side of Napoleon, and at length the Austrian
leader drew off his men to the heights again. He was prepared
to fight another battle on the morrow&mdash;indeed he could scarcely
have avoided it had he wished to do so, for behind him lay the
mountain defiles, towards which Vandamme was marching with
all speed.</p>

<p>Napoleon&rsquo;s plan for the 27th was, as usual, simple in its outline.
As at Friedland, a ravine separated a part of the hostile line of
battle from the rest. The villages west of the Plauen ravine and
even Löbda were occupied in the early morning by General
Metzko with the leading division of Klenau&rsquo;s corps from Freiberg,
and upon Metzko Napoleon intended first to throw the weight
of his attack, giving to Victor&rsquo;s infantry and the cavalry of
Murat, king of Naples, the task of overwhelming the isolated
Austrians. The centre, aided by the defences of the Dresden
suburbs, could hold its own, as the events of the 26th had
shown, the left, now under Ney, with whom served Kellermann&rsquo;s
cavalry and the Young Guard, was to attack Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
Russians on the Pirna road. Thus, for once, Napoleon decided
to attack both flanks of the enemy. His motives in so doing
have been much discussed by the critics; Vandamme&rsquo;s movements,
it may be suggested, contributed to the French emperor&rsquo;s
plan, which if carried out would open the Pirna road. Still,
the left attack may have had a purely tactical object, for in
that quarter was the main body of the Prussians and Russians,
and Napoleon&rsquo;s method was always to concentrate the fury of
the attack on the heaviest masses of the enemy, <i>i.e.</i> the best
target for his own artillery. A very heavy rainstorm during the
night seriously affected the movements of troops on the following
day, but all to Napoleon&rsquo;s advantage, for his more mobile
artillery, reinforced by every horse available in and about
Dresden, was still able to move where the Allied guns sank in
mud. Further, if the cavalry had to walk, or at most trot, through
the fields the opposing infantry was almost always unable to fire
their muskets. &ldquo;You cannot fire; surrender,&rdquo; said Murat to
an Austrian battalion in the battle. &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; they replied;
&ldquo;you cannot charge us.&rdquo; On the appearance of Murat&rsquo;s horse
artillery, however, they had to surrender at once. Under such
conditions, Metzko, unsupported either by Klenau or the main
army beyond the ravine, was an easy victim. Victor from Löbda
drove in the advanced posts and assaulted the line of villages
Wolfnitz-Töltschen; Metzko had to retire to the higher ground
S.W. of the first line, and Murat, with an overwhelming cavalry
force from Cotta and Burgstädl, outflanked his left, broke up
whole battalions, and finally, with the assistance of the renewed
frontal attack of Victor&rsquo;s infantry, annihilated the division.
The Austrian corps of Gyulai arrived too late to save it. A few
formed bodies escaped across the ravine, but Metzko and three-fourths
of his men were killed or taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ney on the other flank, with his left on the Pillnitz
road and his right on the Grosser Garten, had opened his attack.
The Russians offered a strenuous resistance, defending Seidnitz,
Gross Döbritz and Reick with their usual steadiness, and Ney was
so far advanced that several generals at the Allied headquarters
suggested a counter-attack of the centre by way of Strehlen,
so as to cut off the French left from Dresden. This plan was
adopted, but, owing to various misunderstandings, failed of
execution. Thus the Allied centre remained inactive all day,
cannonaded by the Dresden redoubts. One incident only, but
that of great importance, took place here. The tsar, the king
of Prussia, Schwarzenberg and a very large headquarter staff
watched the fighting from a hill near Räcknitz and offered an
easy mark to the French guns. In default of formed bodies to
fire at, the latter had for a moment ceased fire; Napoleon,
riding by, half carelessly told them to reopen, and one of their
first shots, directed at 2000 yards range against the mass of
officers on the sky-line, mortally wounded General Moreau, who
was standing by the emperor Alexander. A council of war
followed. The Allied sovereigns were for continuing the fight;
Schwarzenberg, however, knowing the exhaustion of his troops
decided to retreat. As at Bautzen, the French cavalry was
unable to make any effective pursuit.</p>

<p>The forces engaged were 96,000 French, Saxons, &amp;c., and
200,000 Austrians, Russians and Prussians. The French losses
were about 10,000, or a little over 10%, those of the Allies
38,000 killed, wounded and prisoners (the latter 23,000) or 19%.
They lost also 15 colours and 26 guns.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRESS<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> (from the Fr. <i>dresser</i>, to set out, arrange, formed from
Lat. <i>directus</i>, arranged, <i>dirigere</i>, to direct, arrange), a substantive
of which the current meaning is that of clothing or costume in
general, or, specifically, the principal outer garment worn by a
woman (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Costume</a></span>). The verb &ldquo;to dress&rdquo; has various
applications which can be deduced from its original meaning.
It is thus used not only of the putting on of clothing, but of the
preparing and finishing of leather, the preparation of food for
eating, the application of cleansing and healing substances or of
bandages, &amp;c., to a wound, the drawing up in a correct line of a
body of troops, and, generally, adorning or decking out, as of
a ship with flags. In the language of the theatre the &ldquo;dresser&rdquo;
is the person who looks after the actor&rsquo;s wardrobe and assists
him in the changing of his costumes. For the printer&rsquo;s use of
&ldquo;dresser&rdquo; see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Typography</a></span>.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRESSER<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span>, in furniture, a form of sideboard. The name is
derived from the Fr. <i>dressoir</i>, a piece of furniture used to range or
<i>dresser</i> the more costly appointments of the table. The appliance
is the direct descendant of the credence and the buffet, and is,
indeed, a much more legitimate inheritor of their functions than
the modern sideboard, which, as we know it, is practically an
18th-century invention. It developed into its present shape
about the second quarter of the 17th century, and has since then
changed but little. As a piece of movable furniture it was
made rarely, if at all, after the beginning of the 19th century
until the revival of interest in what is called &ldquo;farmhouse
furniture&rdquo; at the very beginning of the 20th century led in
the first place to the construction of many imitation antique
dressers from derelict pieces of old oak, and especially from
panels of chests, and in the second to the making of avowed
imitations. The dresser conformed to a model which varied
only in detail and in ornament. Its simple and agreeable form
consisted of a long and rather narrow table or slab, with drawers
or cupboards beneath and a tall upright closed-in back arranged
with a varying number of shallow shelves for the reception of
plates; hooks for mugs were often fixed upon the face of these
shelves. Towards the end of the 17th century small cupboards
were often added to the superstructure. The majority of these
dressers were made of oak, but when, early in the Georgian period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page578" id="page578"></a>578</span>
mahogany came into general use, they were frequently inlaid
with that wood; holly and box were also used for inlaying, most
frequently in the shape of plain bands or lines. A peculiarly
effective combination of oak and mahogany is found in the
dressers, as in other &ldquo;farmhouse furniture,&rdquo; made on the borders
of Staffordshire and Shropshire. The excellence of the work of
this kind in that district and in the country lying west of it may
perhaps explain the expression &ldquo;Welsh dresser,&rdquo; which is now
no more than a trade term, not necessarily suggestive of the
place of origin, and applied to all dressers of this type. They are
most frequently found in the houses of small yeomen and substantial
farmers, into which fashion penetrated slowly. The dresser
is now most familiar as necessary plenishing of the kitchen, in
which it is invariably a fixture. In form it is essentially identical
with the movable variety, but it is usually much larger, is made
of deal or other soft wood, and the superstructure has no back.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DREUX<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span>, a town of north-western France, capital of an
arrondissement in the department of Eure-et-Loir, 27 m. N.N.W.
of Chartres by rail. Pop. (1906) 8209. It is situated on the
Blaise, which at this point divides into several arms. It is
overlooked from the north by an eminence on which stands a
ruined medieval castle; within the enclosure of this building
is a gorgeous chapel, begun in 1816 by the dowager duchess of
Orleans, and completed and adorned at great cost by Louis
Philippe. It contains the tombs of the Orleans family, chief
among them that of Louis Philippe, whose remains were removed
from England to Dreux in 1876. The sculptures on the tombs
and the stained glass of the chapel windows are masterpieces
of modern art. The older of the two hôtels-de-ville of Dreux
was built in the early 16th century, chiefly by Clément Métezau,
the founder of a famous family of architects, natives of the
town. It is notable both for the graceful carvings of the façade
and for the fine staircase and architectural details of the interior.
The church of St Pierre, which is Gothic in style, contains good
stained glass and other works of art. The town has a statue of
the poet Jean de Rotrou, born there in 1609. Dreux is the seat
of a subprefect. Among the public institutions are tribunals of
first instance and of commerce, and a communal college. The
manufacture of boots and shoes, metal-founding and tanning,
are carried on, and there is trade in wheat and other agricultural
products and poultry.</p>

<p>Dreux was the capital of the Gallic tribe of the <i>Durocasses</i>.
In 1188 it was taken and burnt by the English; and in 1562
Gaspard de Coligny, and Louis I., prince of Condé, were defeated
in its vicinity by Anne de Montmorency and Francis, duke of
Guise. In 1593 Henry IV. captured the town after a fortnight&rsquo;s
siege. It was occupied by the Germans on the 9th of October
1870, was subsequently evacuated, and was again taken, on the
17th of November, by General Von Tresckow. In the 10th
century Dreux was the chief town of a countship, which Odo,
count of Chartres, ceded to king Robert, and Louis VI. gave to
his son Robert, whose grandson Peter of Dreux, younger brother
of Count Robert III., became duke of Brittany by his marriage
with Alix, daughter of Constance of Brittany by her second
husband Guy of Thouars. By the marriage of the countess
Jeanne II. with Louis, viscount of Thouars (d. 1370), the Capetian
countship of Dreux passed into the Thouars family. In 1377
and 1378, however, two of the three co-heiresses of Jeanne,
Perronelle and Marguerite, sold their shares of the countship
to King Charles V. Charles VI. gave it to Arnaud Amanien
d&rsquo;Albret, but took it back in order to give it to his brother Louis
of Orleans (1407); later he gave it back to the lords of Albret.
Francis of Cleves laid claim to it in the 16th century as heir of
the d&rsquo;Albrets of Orval, but the parlement of Paris declared the
countship to be crown property. It was given to Catherine de&rsquo;
Medici (1539), then to Francis, duke of Alençon (1569); it was
pledged to Charles de Bourbon, count of Soissons, and through
him passed to the houses of Orleans, Vendôme and Condé.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DREW<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span>, the name of a family of American actors. <span class="sc">John
Drew</span> (1827-1862) was born in Dublin and made his first New
York appearance in 1846. He played Irish and light comedy
parts with success in all the American cities, and was manager
of the Arch Street theatre in Philadelphia. He visited England
in 1855, and Australia in 1859, and died in Philadelphia. His
wife, <span class="sc">Louise Lane Drew</span> (1820-1897), was the daughter of a
London actor, and in 1827 went to America, appearing as the
Duke of York to the elder Booth&rsquo;s Richard III., and as Albert
to Edwin Forrest&rsquo;s William Tell. After this she starred as a
child actress, and then as leading lady. She had been twice
married before she became Mrs Drew in 1850. <span class="correction" title="amended from Fom">From</span> 1861 to
1892 she had the management of the Arch Street theatre in
Philadelphia. In 1880 she toured with Joseph Jefferson in his
elaborate revival of <i>The Rivals</i>, playing Mrs Malaprop to perfection.
She had three children, John, Sidney and Georgiana,
wife of Maurice Barrymore (1847-1905), and mother of
Lionel and Ethel Barrymore, all actors. The eldest son, <span class="sc">John
Drew</span> (b. 1853), began his stage career under his mother&rsquo;s
management in Philadelphia as Plumper in <i>Cool as a Cucumber</i>,
on the 22nd of March 1873; and after playing with Edwin
Booth and others, became leading man in Augustin Daly&rsquo;s
company in 1879. His association with this company, and with
Ada Rehan as the leading lady, constituted a brilliant period
in recent stage history, his Petruchio being only one, though
perhaps the most striking, of a series of famous impersonations.
In 1892 he left Daly&rsquo;s company, and began a career as a &ldquo;star.&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DREW, SAMUEL<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> (1765-1833), English theologian, was born
in the parish of St Austell, in Cornwall, on the 6th of March 1765.
His father was a poor farm labourer, and could not afford to
send him to school long enough even to learn to read and write.
At ten he was apprenticed to a shoemaker, and at twenty he
settled in the town of St Austell, first as manager for a shoemaker,
and in 1787 began business on his own account. He had already
gained a reputation in his narrow circle as a keen debater and a
jovial companion, and it is said that he had several smuggling
adventures. He was first aroused to serious thought in 1785 by
a funeral sermon preached over his elder brother by Adam
Clarke. He joined the Methodists, was soon employed as a
class leader and local preacher, and continued to preach till
a few months before his death. His opportunities of gaining
knowledge were very scanty, but he strenuously set himself to
make the most of them. It is stated that an accidental introduction
to Locke&rsquo;s great essay determined the ultimate direction
of his studies. In 1798 the first part of Thomas Paine&rsquo;s <i>Age of
Reason</i> was put into his hands; and in the following year he
made his first appearance as an author by publishing his <i>Remarks</i>
on that work. The book was favourably received, and was
republished in 1820. Drew had begun to meditate a greater
attempt before he wrote his <i>Remarks on Paine</i>; and, encouraged
by the antiquary John Whitaker, he published his <i>Essay on
the Immateriality and Immortality of the Soul</i> in 1802. This
work made the &ldquo;Cornish metaphysician,&rdquo; as he was called,
widely known, and for some time it held a high place in the
judgment of the religious world as a conclusive argument on
its subject. A fifth edition appeared in 1831. Drew continued
to work at his trade till 1805, when he entered into an engagement
with Dr Thomas Coke, a prominent Wesleyan official, which
enabled him to devote himself entirely to literature. In 1809
he published his <i>Essay on the Identity and General Resurrection
of the Human Body</i>, perhaps the most original of his works,
which reached a second edition in 1822. In 1814 he completed
a history of Cornwall begun by F. Hitchins. In 1819 he removed
to Liverpool, being appointed editor of the <i>Imperial Magazine</i>,
then newly established, and in 1821 to London, the business
being then transferred to the capital. Here he filled the post
of editor till his death, and had also the supervision of all
works issued from the Caxton Press. He was an unsuccessful
competitor for the Burnett prize offered in 1811 for an essay on
the existence and attributes of God. The work which he then
wrote, and which in his own judgment was his best, was published
in 1820, under the title of <i>An Attempt to demonstrate from Reason
and Revelation the Necessary Existence, Essential Perfections, and
Superintending Providence of an Eternal Being, who is the Creator,
the Supporter, and the Governor of all Things</i> (2 vols. 8 vo). This
procured him the degree of M.A. from the university of Aberdeen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page579" id="page579"></a>579</span>
Among Drew&rsquo;s lesser writings are a <i>Life of Dr Thomas Coke</i>
(1817), and a work on the deity of Christ (1813). He died at
Helston in Cornwall on the 29th of March 1833. He was a man
of strong mind, honourable spirit and affectionate disposition,
energetic both in speech and in writing.</p>

native of Austrian Tirol, who emigrated to America in 1817, and,
after some years spent as a portrait-painter, became a banker
and the founder of the house of Drexel &amp; Company. Anthony,

his brothers Francis and Joseph, succeeded to the control of
the business, and organized the banking houses of Drexel,
Morgan &amp; Company, New York, of which his brother Joseph W.

<p><span class="bold">DREYFUS, ALFRED<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (1859-&emsp;&emsp;), French soldier, of Jewish
parentage, the scandal of whose condemnation for treason and
subsequent rehabilitation convulsed French political life between
1894 and 1899, and only ended in 1906, was born in Mülhausen,
Upper Alsace, removing to Paris in 1874. After going through
the usual course of military instruction with credit, he became
a sous-lieutenant in the artillery in 1882, and was promoted
captain in 1889; and, after passing through the <i>École de Guerre</i>
with distinction, he was appointed to the general staff. His name
was, however, unknown to the general public till he was arrested
on the 15th of October 1894 on a charge of selling military
secrets to Germany, condemned, publicly degraded (January 4,
1895), and transported (March 10) to the Ile du Diable, French
Guiana. The story of the subsequent proceedings in this celebrated
case is told in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Anti-Semitism</a></span>, and need not
here be repeated. It was not till 1899 that the unfortunate
prisoner was brought back to France for retrial by court-martial,
and even then, so strong was the anti-Semitic and military
prejudice, he was again found guilty &ldquo;with extenuating circumstances&rdquo;
at Rennes (September 9), though ten days later he
was &ldquo;pardoned&rdquo; by President Loubet. It was not till the Cour
de Cassation ordered a further investigation, and on the 12th
of July 1906 decided that his conviction had been based on a
forgery and that Dreyfus was innocent, that the agitation came
to a final conclusion. He was then restored to his rank in the
army and promoted major. But the anti-Semitic and anti-Dreyfusard
spirit in certain French circles could not easily be
quelled even then; and on the occasion of the translation of the
remains of Emile Zola (Dreyfus&rsquo;s determined champion) to the
Pantheon on the 4th of June 1908, Major Dreyfus was shot at
and wounded by a fanatical journalist named Gregori, who was
subsequently acquitted by a Paris jury of the charge of attempted
murder, his own plea being that he had merely intended a
&ldquo;demonstration.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRIFT<a name="ar32" id="ar32"></a></span> (from &ldquo;drive&rdquo;), a verb or noun used in various
connexions with the sense of propelled motion, especially (but
not necessarily) of an aimless sort, undirected. Thus it is possible
to speak of a snow-drift, an <span class="correction" title="amended from accumlation">accumulation</span> driven by the wind;
of a ship drifting out of its course; of the drift of a speech, <i>i.e.</i>
its general tendency. The word is also used in some technical
senses, more immediately resulting from the action of driving
something in. But the most important technical use of the word
is in geology, as introduced by C. Lyell in 1840 in place of
&ldquo;Diluvium.&rdquo; The earlier geologists had been in the habit of
dividing the Quaternary deposits into an older Diluvium and a
younger Alluvium; the latter is still employed in England,
but the former has dropped out of use, though it is still retained
by some continental writers. The Alluvium was distinguished
from Diluvium by the fact that its mammalian fossils were
representatives of still living forms, but it is a matter of great
difficulty to separate these two divisions in practice. &ldquo;The term
drift is now applied generally to the Quaternary deposits, which
consist for the most part of gravel, sand, loam or brickearth and
clay; it naturally refers to strata laid down at some distance
from the rocks to whose destruction they are largely due; but,
although applied to river deposits, the word drift is more appropriately
used in reference to the accumulations of the Glacial
period.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The occurrence of stones and boulders far removed from their
parent source early attracted the attention of geologists, but
for a long period the phenomena, now known as of glacial
origin, were unexplained, and the drifts were looked upon as
little more than &lsquo;extraneous rubbish,&rsquo; the product of geological
agents, quite distinct from those which helped to form the more
&rsquo;solid&rsquo; rocks that underlie them.&rdquo; (See H. B. Woodward, <i>The
Geology of England and Wales</i>, 2nd ed., 1887.) The conception
of an underlying &ldquo;solid&rdquo; geological structure covered by a
superficial mantle of &ldquo;drift&rdquo; is still retained for certain practical
purposes; thus, the Geological Survey of Great Britain issues
many of the maps in two forms, the &ldquo;Solid Edition,&rdquo; showing
the &ldquo;solid geology,&rdquo; which embraces all igneous rocks and the
stratified rocks older than Pleistocene, and the &ldquo;Drift Edition,&rdquo;
which shows only such older strata as are unobscured by drift.</p>

<p>In writing and in conversation the geological expression
&ldquo;drift&rdquo; is now usually understood to mean Glacial drift,
including boulder clay and all the varieties of sand, gravel and
clay deposits formed by the agency of ice sheets, glaciers and
icebergs. But in the &ldquo;Drift&rdquo; maps many other types of deposit
are indicated, such, for instance, as the ordinary modern alluvium
of rivers, and the older river terraces (River-drift of various ages),
including gravels, brickearth and loam; old raised sea beaches
and blown-sand (Aeolian-drift); the &ldquo;Head&rdquo; of Cornwall and
Devon, an angular detritus consisting of stones with clay or
loam; clay-with-flints, rainwash (landwash), scree and talus;

<p><span class="bold">DRILL.<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> (1) A tool for boring or making holes in hard substances,
such as stone, metal, &amp;c. (an adaptation in the 17th
century from the Dutch <i>dril</i> or <i>drille</i>, from <i>drillen</i>, to turn,
bore a hole; according to the New English Dictionary the
word is not to be connected with the English &ldquo;thrill&rdquo;). The word
<i>drillen</i> was used in Dutch, German and Danish, from the 17th
century for training in military exercises and was adopted into
English in the same sense. The origin of the application seems
to be in the primary sense of &ldquo;to turn round,&rdquo; from the turning
of the troops in their evolutions and from the turning of the
weapons in the soldiers&rsquo; hands. Drill is, formally, the preparation
of soldiers for their duties in war by the practice or rehearsal
of movements in military order and the handling of arms, and,
psychologically, the method of producing in the individual soldier
habits of self-control and of mechanically precise actions under disturbing
conditions, and of rendering the common instinctive will
of a body of men, large or small, amenable to the control of, and
susceptible to a stimulus imparted by its commander&rsquo;s will.</p>

<p>(2) A furrow made in the soil in which seed may be sown,
and a machine used for sowing seed in such furrows (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sowing</a></span>).
The word is somewhat doubtful in origin. It may be the same
as an obsolete word &ldquo;drill,&rdquo; to trickle, flow in drops, also a
small stream or flow of water, a rill, and is possibly an altered
form of &ldquo;trill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(3) In zoology, the native name of a large short-tailed west
African baboon, <i>Papio leucophaeus</i>, closely allied to the mandrill
(<i>q.v.</i>), but distinguished by the absence of brilliant blue and
scarlet on the jaws of the fully adult males.</p>

<table class="nobctr" style="float: right; width: 190px;" summary="Illustration">

<p>(4) The name of a fabric made in both linen and cotton, and
commonly bleached and finished stiff. The word is a shortened
form of &ldquo;drilling,&rdquo; from the German <i>drillich</i>, or &ldquo;three-threaded,&rdquo;
and is so named because the weave originally used
in its construction is what is termed the three-leaf twill, nine
repeats of which appear in the accompanying figure, while
immediately below the design is an intersection
of all the nine threads with the first
pick. It is essentially a warp-faced fabric;
that is, the upper surface is composed mostly
of warp threads. In the figure it will be seen
that two out of every three threads appear
on the surface, and, by introducing a greater
number of threads per inch than picks per inch, the weft is made
to occupy a still more subordinate position so far as the upper
surface of the cloth is concerned. Although the weave shown
is still extensively used in this branch, there are others, <i>e.g.</i> the
4-thread and the 5-thread weaves, which are employed for the
production of this cloth. Large quantities of drill are shipped
to the Eastern markets and to other sub-tropical centres, from
which it is sold for clothing. In temperate climates it forms a
satisfactory material for ladies&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s summer clothing,
and it is used by chefs, hairdressers, provision merchants, grocers,
buttermen, painters and decorators, &amp;c., while many of the long
jackets or overalls, such as those worn by many mill and factory
managers, are made from the same material.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRINKING VESSELS.<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> <a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The use of special vessels for drinking
purposes may fairly be assumed to have had a natural origin
and development. From a practical point of view it would soon
be found desirable to provide vessels for liquids in addition to
those serving to hold food. As in many other commonplace
details of modern life, we must turn to the primitive races to
understand how our present conditions were reached. In almost
all parts of the world many of the products of nature are capable
of serving such purposes, with little or no change at the hands
of man; in tropical and sub-tropical climates the coco-nut and
the gourd or calabash require but little change to adapt them
as the most convenient of drinking utensils; the eggs of the
larger birds, such as the ostrich or the emu, shells, like the
nautilus and other univalves, as well as the deeper bivalves,
are equally convenient. Such natural objects are in fact used
by the uncivilized tribes of Africa, America and Polynesia, as
well as, in some cases, by the white races who have intruded
into those parts of the world, and adopted some of the native
habits. In Paraguay, for example, the so-called &ldquo;Paraguay
tea,&rdquo; an infusion of the <i>yerba maté</i> (<i>Ilex paraguayensis</i>), is drunk
through a tube from a small gourd held in the hand, and often
handsomely mounted in silver or even gold. In the same way,
as we shall see, civilized man has adopted nearly all the natural
forms that were found convenient by the savage, altering and
adorning them in accordance with the taste of the time or
country where they were used.</p>

<p>Another line of development, however, has been found to be
the natural outcome of the human mind. Nothing could form
a more practical drinking cup than the half of a coco-nut shell
or part of a gourd. Such cups, however, in the countries where
the plants producing them are common, would be easily obtained,
and every one, rich or poor, could possess one or more. In order,
therefore, to distinguish the chief&rsquo;s possessions from those of
his inferiors, his cup is often made with great labour, from some
more intractable material, wood or stone, though in practically
the same form as that of the natural object.</p>

<p>Among European races in medieval times the same lines have
been followed, though for different reasons. Human ingenuity,
though perhaps originally inspired by natural forms,
is apt to turn aside into more artificial channels.
<span class="sidenote">Early drinking cups.</span>
The invention of the potter&rsquo;s art (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ceramics</a></span>),
where the plastic nature of the raw material renders it
capable of infinite changes of form, gave rise to types of vessels
having no obvious or necessary relation to the productions of
nature. In Britain and in northern Europe generally, the
interments of the races of the Neolithic and Bronze Ages have
furnished vessels of pottery of a beaker-like form, to which the
name of &ldquo;drinking-cups&rdquo; has been given. It must be confessed
that the evidence for attributing such a use to them is slender,
and mainly consists of the fact that their thin lips would render
them better adapted for the purpose than the other pottery
vessels found with them, some of which, on equally slight
grounds, have been called food vessels. The general use and
acceptance of the term by two generations of archaeologists is,
however, an adequate reason for a passing mention in this place.
In the later prehistoric times of Europe vessels of gold, bronze
and other materials, including amber, were made, sometimes of
elegant forms, and would seem to have been used as drinking
vessels; still, this is again an assumption, though a fairly probable
one. A small gold cup with handle was found in a barrow
at Rillaton, Cornwall; one of amber of a similar form was found
at Hove, and a third of shale near Honiton. All of these doubtless
may be referred to the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>Schliemann found many drinking vessels in his exploration
of the superimposed cities of Troy. A pretty form is that found
in the first city. It is of clay, and closely resembles
an early Victorian tea cup on a high foot. This form
<span class="sidenote">New forms found by Schliemann.</span>
is of interest, as Schliemann discovered the same both
at Tiryns and Mycenae, five from the latter site being
of gold, while the type also occurs from Ialysus in Rhodes in
association with bronze swords. This Trojan cup was found at
a depth of 50 ft. below the present surface and about 18 ft. below
the stratum of what Schliemann claimed to be the Homeric
Troy. In his second city appears a different type of ware,
somewhat fantastic in form, one vessel being in the form of a
sow, while others foreshadow the <i>crater</i> and <i>amphora</i> of later
and more familiar Greek wares.</p>

<p>But the drinking vessel to which Schliemann draws most
attention is the tall cup of a trumpet form furnished with two
earlike loop handles. This curious and original type occurs
also in the Third (or Homeric), Fourth and Sixth Cities, with
little if any change. Schliemann devotes some pages to the
discussion of the form, in which he sees the <span class="grk" title="depas amphikypellon">&#948;&#941;&#960;&#945;&#962; &#7936;&#956;&#966;&#953;&#954;&#973;&#960;&#949;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span><a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
of Homer, which has been more usually understood to mean
an hour-glass shaped cup, in which the distinguishing feature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page581" id="page581"></a>581</span>
was two cups, not two handles. He applies the same term to a
drinking vessel of a very different form, found with several others
in the Third City. This is a sauce-boat shaped vessel<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a> of gold,
made with a lip for pouring or drinking at either end, and with
two loop handles. This equals those previously mentioned in
originality of form; with it were found others of gold, silver
and electrum (<i>i.e.</i> 4 parts of gold to 1 of silver). Of these three
were shaped like 18th-century coffee cups but wanting handles.
In the Sixth City appear forms more nearly approaching those of
later times, particularly prototypes of the <i>cantharus</i> and <i>scyphus</i>.</p>

<p>These discoveries in the various strata of Troy may be taken
as the analogues in the Mediterranean and hither Asia of the
later Stone and Bronze Ages of northern Europe, with an
allowance of some centuries of greater antiquity for the former.</p>

<p>It is not proposed in this article to deal with the ceramic and
metallic drinking vessels of the Greeks and Romans, of what
is generally known as the classical period (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ceramics</a></span> and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Plate</a></span>). It may be mentioned, however, that both on the Rhine
and in various places in Britain, notably at Castor in Northamptonshire
and in the New Forest, were factories where large
numbers of <i>pocula</i> or drinking cups were made; those made on
the Rhine and at Castor bearing legends to indicate their use.
Many of these are to be seen in the British Museum and in the
Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne.</p>

<p>After the decline of Roman power, the Gothic and Scandinavian
races who replaced the Romans in central and northern Europe
brought with them their own forms and types of drinking
vessels. These, from about the 4th century, replaced
<span class="sidenote">Gothic and Scandinavian types.</span>
the well-known Roman vessels. The northern
barbarians were as great drinkers as fighters, and their
literature recites with equal zest the richness of their drinking
cups as the power and deadly qualities of their arms. Fortunately
the practice of burying with the dead warrior all his
property, or at least as much of it as he would be supposed to
need, has preserved to our day the actual vessels in use by the
pagan northmen who pervaded northern Europe from the
4th century onward. Saxon graves in Britain have furnished
great numbers of drinking cups and horns, in many cases quite
unbroken. From the remains, of which the chief series are in
the British and Liverpool Museums, we can learn a great deal
to amplify the references in literature. The richest single
interment that has yet been found was within the present churchyard
at Taplow. Here under a huge mound lay buried a Saxon
chieftain surrounded by his belongings; arms defensive and
offensive, his drinking cups, and even his game of draughts.
The drinking vessels consisted of five cows&rsquo; horns and four glass
cups. The former were of great size, 2 ft. long, richly mounted
at the mouth and at the point with silver bands embossed and
gilt. The glasses also were of great size and of a type familiar
in Saxon interments. Each was of a trumpet shape, with a
small foot, while the sides were ornamented with hollow pointed
tubes bent downwards, and open on the inner side, so that the
liquid would fill them. Such a plan is most unpractical, and it
must have been very difficult to keep the vessels clean. Glasses
of this uncommon form have not been found elsewhere than in
Saxon graves, either in England or in the north of the continent.
Other types are perhaps nearly as characteristic, though of simpler
construction. One of these is a simple cone of glass, sometimes
quite plain, at others ornamented with an applied spiral glass
thread, or more rarely with festoons of white glass embedded
in the body of the vessel. A third form is a plain cup or bowl
widely expanded at the mouth and with a rounded base, so
that it could only be set down when empty, in fact a true
&ldquo;tumbler.&rdquo; This feature is in fact a very common one in the
drinking vessels of the Saxon race. There are many other
varieties, plain cylindrical goblets, generally with ornamental
glass threads on the outside, and a more usual type has a rounded
body somewhat of the shape of an orange with a wide plain
mouth. Many of all these classes were found in the famous
cemetery known as the King&rsquo;s Field at Faversham in Kent (the
relics from which are now in the British Museum), at Chessel
Down in the Isle of Wight, and in the cemetery within the
ancient camp on High Down, near Worthing. In Belgium,
France and Germany the same types occur, and even as far
north as Scandinavia, where they are found in association with
Roman coins of the 4th century. On the continent, however,
additional types are found that do not occur in Britain&mdash;one
of these is a drinking glass in the form of a hunting horn with
glass threads forming an ornamental design on the outside.
From the wide distribution of these types, it seems certain
that they sprang originally from a common centre, and the slender
evidence available on the subject seems to point to that centre
having been somewhere on the lower Rhine. Although glass
seems to have been popular and by no means rare as a material
for drinking vessels, other materials also were used. A large
number of the smaller pottery vessels would serve such a purpose,
and in one grave at Broomfield in Essex two small wooden cups
were found which, from their small size and thinness, were no
doubt used for liquid.</p>

<p>Of the later Saxon domestic utensils nothing remains, the
habit of burying such objects with the dead having ceased on
the gradual introduction of Christianity through the country.
Manuscripts are our only resource, and they are not only of great
rarity, but in the main rudely and conventionally drawn in their
details. In those of the 9th to the 11th century various simple
forms are seen, some resembling our modern tumbler in shape,
others like a dice box. Horns as drinking vessels certainly
retained their popularity at all times, surviving especially among
the northern nations, and many of the vessels of this form were
no doubt actual horns, though horn-shaped vessels were often
made of other materials. Until we come to the 13th and 14th
centuries there is an absolute dearth of the actual objects used
in domestic life. And here we begin with plate used in the
service of the church.</p>

<p>The drinking vessel possessing the most unbroken history is
doubtless the chalice of the Christian Church.<a name="fa4c" id="fa4c" href="#ft4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a> Like other
ceremonial objects it was no doubt differentiated from
the drinking cups in ordinary use by a gradual transition,
<span class="sidenote">Church vessels.</span>
and in the early centuries it is unlikely that it
differed either in form or material from the ordinary domestic
vessel of the time. Figures of such vessels, apparently with a
symbolic intention, are found upon early Christian tombstones,
and it has been contended that the vessel indicated the grave
of a priest. While this may be the case, the similarity of the
vessel represented to the ordinary non-liturgical form renders
the conclusion somewhat weak. Among objects found under
conditions which lend colour to their specific use as chalices are
the bottoms of glass vessels found inserted in plaster in the
Catacombs at Rome; but here again the Jesuit Padre Garrucci
was unable to find any evidence to support such a conclusion.
It is not in fact until the 6th century that the sacred vessel
would appear to have assumed a definite form. From about that
time date the lost golden chalices of Monza, representations
of which still exist in that city; and the famous chalice of
Gourdon in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris is probably of
about the same time. All of these are two-handled with a vase-shaped
body and supported on a high foot; and thus quite
unlike the more recent medieval types. Two glass vases of
exactly this two-handled form are in the Slade collection at the
British Museum, and may well have been chalices. Another
chalice, in the same collection, of the 6th or 7th century, was
found with a silver treasure at Lampsacus on the Hellespont.
It is of silver, with a cylindrical body and small expanding
foot; with it were found a number of silver spoons and dishes,
the former inscribed with the names of Apostles, Greek hexameters
and lines from Virgil&rsquo;s Eclogues. No doubt the whole
was the treasure of a monastery, buried and never reclaimed.
So far as evidence exists for the form of the chalice, the vase-shape
with two handles seems to have been mainly succeeded
by a goblet with straight sides and without handles; these latter
in great part disappeared. Then came the rounded cup-shaped
bowl as seen in the well-known Kremsmünster chalice. An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page582" id="page582"></a>582</span>
interesting silver vessel, probably a chalice, found at Trewhiddle
in Cornwall, is in the British Museum. It is of plain semi-oviform
shape, and dates from the 9th century. The 13th century
chalice was usually a broad somewhat shallow cup, on a conical
base, and squat in its general lines as compared with those of
later date. These gradually became taller, and with a bowl
smaller in proportion, following the tendency of the civil vessels
towards more elegant lines. Both civil and religious vessels
eventually carried this tendency to an extreme point, so that in
the 17th century the continental chalices and standing cups
had lost all sense of true artistic proportions; the bowl of the
chalice had greatly shrunk in size while the foot had become
huge and highly elaborate, both in general form and in ornamental
details. In Britain chalices ceased to be used in the English
church in the reign of Edward VI., and were replaced by communion
cups. These were much plainer in make, recalling in
their outlines the goblet form of about a thousand years earlier,
the sides of the bowl being concave, or nearly straight, as opposed
to the convexity of the chalice, while the paten was reversed
over the mouth and so arranged as to form a closely fitting cover.
With the beginning of the 17th century English communion
cups again followed the civil fashion in adapting the outline of
the Venetian drinking glass, a shape which has survived to our
own days.</p>

<p>The materials of which chalices were made in the early
centuries seem to have been as various as those of ordinary
vessels. Glass was undoubtedly a favourite substance, perhaps
from its lending itself readily to scrupulous cleanliness; but
wood, horn, ivory and similar materials were undoubtedly in
use, and were from time to time condemned as improper by the
Fathers of the Church. Pewter was in common use, and it was
not an unusual practice in the 12th and 13th centuries to place
sacramental vessels, of this or more precious metal, in the grave
of an ecclesiastic. Bronze was also used, and the Kremsmünster
chalice is of that metal, which was a favourite one in the Celtic
church. But gold or silver chalices were no doubt always
preferred when they could be obtained.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned here that it was a common practice
in the 16th century and later in England for laymen to make
gifts to the church of vessels of an entirely domestic character
for use in the service. Many of these from their associations,
and in the character of the designs upon them, were entirely
unsuited for such purposes, and in our own time, when a healthy
desire has sprung up for the proper investigation of such matters,
many such unsuitable vessels have been withdrawn from use.
Domestic plate, however, being much more highly appreciated
by collectors, there has been a regrettable tendency on the part
of the holders of such pieces to sell them to the highest bidders;
the tendency is to be deplored, for while they remain the property
of the church, they are a national asset; if sold by auction,
there is a great probability of their going abroad.</p>

<p>It would seem fairly certain that the ordinary drinking vessel
of medieval times was, like the trenchers of wood, turned on the
lathe. Of these the commoner varieties have entirely
disappeared, having become useless from distortion
<span class="sidenote">Medieval vessels for common uses.</span>
or other damage. Such as have come down to our
own time owe their preservation to the added refinement
of a silver mount. Vessels of this kind are known as
<i>mazer</i> bowls, a word of uncertain origin, but undoubtedly,
in the medieval sense, indicating wood of some more
<span class="sidenote">Mazers.</span>
or less valuable kind, and not improbably, in the 16th
century, maple or a wood of that appearance. Spenser in the
&ldquo;Shepherd&rsquo;s Kalendar&rdquo; speaks of &ldquo;a mazer ywrought of the
maple warre.&rdquo; Although such vessels are mentioned in the
inventories and other contemporary records as far back as the
12th century, no example is known to exist of an earlier date
than the 14th century, of which date there are two in the possession
of Harbledown hospital. This type of drinking vessel
was in common use in well-to-do households until the 16th
century, when a change of fashion and the greater luxury and
refinement dictated the adoption of more elegant and complex
forms. The ordinary mazer was a shallow bowl (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Plate</a></span>,
Plate II.) about 6 in. in diameter, with a broad expanding
rim of silver gilt often engraved with a motto in black letter
or Lombardic capitals, at times referring to the function of
the cup, such as:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;In the name of the Trinity</p>
<p class="i05">Fille the Kup and drinke to me.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">or,</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;Potum et nos benedicat Agios.&rdquo;</p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Within the bowl, in the centre is often found a circular medallion
called a &ldquo;print&rdquo; with some device upon it, engraved and filled
with enamel. The reason of this addition may conceivably
be found in the fact that such bowls were sometimes made from
the lower half of a gourd or calabash, in the centre of which
would be a rough projection whence the fibres of the fruit had
diverged. A rarer form of mazer has the characters just mentioned
and in addition is mounted upon a high foot, bringing
it nearer to the category of standing cups or &ldquo;hanaps.&rdquo; The
famous Scrope mazer belonging to York Minster (early 15th
century) stands upon three small feet. Of the hanap type
examples are in the possession of Pembroke College, Cambridge
(the Foundress&rsquo; Cup), and All Souls&rsquo; College, Oxford, the former
an exceedingly fine specimen, of the third quarter of the 15th
century. The form dictated originally by the simple wooden
cup was at times carried out entirely in silver, or even in stone,
mazer-like cups being found either entirely in metal or with
the main portion made of serpentine or some other ornamental
stone. An example of the former from the Hamilton Palace
collection, as well as several ordinary mazers, are to be seen in
the British Museum. The types above described are of English
origin, with the exception of that made entirely of silver, which is
thought to be French. Most of the continental forms differed
from the English, and were more elaborately finished. One of
the finest is that which belonged to Louis de Male, last count of
Flanders. It is an exceedingly thin, shallow bowl of fine-grained
wood, with a cover of the same make. The latter is surmounted
by a silver figure of a falcon holding a shield in its mouth with
the arms of the count. The foot is of silver with lozenge-shaped
panels inserted, bearing in enamel the arms of the count. A
German form of the 16th century consisted of a depressed
sphere of wood for the bowl, with a silver rim, and a cover
formed of a similarly shaped sphere, called in France a &ldquo;creusequin.&rdquo;
Such mazers were furnished in addition with a short
metal handle turned up at the end, a feature unknown in the
English types. All of these again are to be seen in the British
Museum series.</p>

<p>Although the use of wooden vessels more or less elaborately
mounted was continued well into the 16th century as a fashion,
many other materials of far greater value were in use
among the wealthy long before that time. Crystal,
<span class="sidenote">Hanaps.</span>
agate and other hard stones, ivory, Chinese porcelain, as well as
more ordinary wares, were all in use, as well as the precious
metals. The inventories of the 14th and 15th centuries are full
of entries showing that such precious cups were fairly common.
Of gold cups of any antiquity naturally but few remain; the
intrinsic value of the metal probably is a sufficient explanation.
One of the most important in existence is however preserved
in the British Museum, viz. the royal gold cup of the kings of
England and France. It is of nearly pure gold with a broad
bowl and a high foot, the cover pyramidal. The whole is ornamented
with translucent enamels of the most perfect quality,
and with a little damage in one part, absolutely well preserved.
The subjects represented on it are scenes from the life of St
Agnes, in two rows, one on the cover and one outside the bowl;
on the foot are the symbols of the four Evangelists, and around
the base a coronal of leaves alternating with pearls; the cover
originally had a similar adjunct, but it has unfortunately been
cut away. This is the only piece of royal plate of the treasures
of the kings of England and France that now remains, and its
history has been traced from the time it was made, about the
year 1380, to the present time. It was made by one of the
goldsmiths of the luxurious Duc de Berri, the brother of Charles
V. of France, no doubt to offer as a gift to the king, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page583" id="page583"></a>583</span>
birthday was St Agnes&rsquo; day. It was, however, never presented,
probably owing to the death of Charles V. in 1380. The duc
de Berri was not on friendly terms with his nephew Charles VI.,
but on their being reconciled he presented the young king with
this cup. The troubles of his reign led to the invasion of France
by Henry V. of England, and the ultimate appointment of his
brother, John, duke of Bedford, as regent. The necessities
of the half-insane Charles doubtless caused this cup and other
valuables to pass into the possession of the regent in exchange
for ready money, for it appears in the duke of Bedford&rsquo;s will,
under which it passed into the treasury of Henry VI. There
it remained and appears in all subsequent royal inventories
up to the time of James I. This monarch, whose motto was
&ldquo;Beati pacifici,&rdquo; received with joy the embassy sent from
Spain in the year 1610 to conclude the first treaty of peace with
England since the Armada, and showered upon the envoy, Don
Juan de Velasco, constable of Castile, the most lavish and
extravagant gifts. The constable, in fact, was so impressed by
the warmth of his reception that he printed an account of his
embassy, and from this work the main story of the cup has
eventually been traced. On his return to Spain the constable,
a piously disposed man, presented this cup, with many other
valuable gifts, to the convent of Santa Clara Medina de Pomar
at Burgos, of which his sister was Superior. Although it was a
domestic vessel, a &ldquo;hanap&rdquo; in fact, the constable elected that
it should be consecrated and made use of as a chalice at great
festivals. And so it continued to be used from the early years of
the 17th century until about the year 1882, when the convent
having fallen upon evil times, it was decided to sell this precious
relic. A priest from the Argentine being at the time in Burgos,
it was confided to him to sell in Paris, and he deposited the sum
of £100 by way of security. This was all that the unfortunate
nuns at Burgos ever received in return for their chalice, for
they never saw the priest again. He took the cup to Paris,
arriving in the month of September, when the majority of the
well-to-do are away from town. After many failures to dispose
of it, he ultimately succeeded in selling it to Baron Jerome
Pichon for the sum of about £400, practically its weight in gold.
The baron, after vainly trying to resell it at various sums from
£20,000 downwards, eventually parted with it to Messrs Wertheimer
of Bond Street for £8000, and that firm very liberally
ceded it to Sir Wollaston Franks for the same sum, and it was
finally secured by a subscription for the British Museum.</p>

<p>Such is the story of one of the most remarkable &ldquo;hanaps&rdquo;
in existence. The word &ldquo;hanap&rdquo; is translated by Cotgrave in his
French dictionary of 1660 as &ldquo;a drinking cup or goblet,&rdquo; and
probably was intended to mean what would be called a standing
cup, that is, raised on a foot, to distinguish it from a bowl of the
mazer class. Such vessels were chiefly used to ornament the
dinner table or sideboard, in the way that loving-cups are now
used at civic banquets, where, almost alone in fact, the ancient
ceremonial of the table is still observed to some extent; and the
loving-cup is the direct descendant of the hanap of the middle
ages.</p>

<p>Of all the ornaments of the table in medieval times the most conspicuous
was probably the &ldquo;nef.&rdquo; This was in the form of a ship
(<i>navis</i>), as its name implies, and originally was designed
to hold the table utensils of the host&mdash;knives, napkins,
<span class="sidenote">Nefs.</span>
and at times even the wine. Some of the later examples which
alone survive are carried out with the greatest elaboration, the
sails and rigging being carefully finished and with a number of
figures on the deck. The reason for the existence of such an
article of table furniture was doubtless the fear of poison. As
in course of time this became less, the nef changed its character,
and became either a mere ornament, or sometimes was capable
of being used as a drinking vessel. The former, however, was
much more common, and the number of nefs that can be practically
used as drinking cups is small.</p>

<p>In the 15th and 16th centuries the shapes, decoration and
materials of drinking vessels were almost endless. A favourite
object to be so adapted was an ostrich egg, and many can be
seen in museums in elaborate silver mounts; coco-nuts were also
used in the same way, and Chinese and other Oriental wares
then of great variety, were often turned into cups and vases by
<span class="sidenote">16th-century types.</span>
ingeniously devised silver mounting. The use of drinking
vessels either formed of actual horns or of other
materials was common in the 15th and 16th centuries,
especially in the north. They were usually provided
with feet so as to serve as standing cups, and some of them were
mounted with great richness. An excellent example is the
famous drinking-horn in the possession of Queen&rsquo;s College,
Oxford, dating from the 14th century. The medieval beliefs
about &ldquo;griffins&rsquo; claws&rdquo; still survived to this late date, and a
horn cup in the British Museum bears the inscription &ldquo;Ein
Greifen Klau bin ich genannt, In Asia, Africa wohl bekannt.&rdquo;
Another horn, probably that of an ibex, is in the same institution,
and has a silver mount inscribed &ldquo;Gryphi unguis divo Cuthberto
dunelmensi sacer.&rdquo; The elegant natural curve of the horn adds
greatly to the charm of the vessel. In Germany the ingenuity
of the silversmith was turned in the direction of making vessels
in the forms of animals, at times in allusion to the coat of arms
of the patron. Stags, lions, bears and various birds are often
found; the head generally removable so as to form a small cup
Switzerland and south Germany had a special type, in the form
of the figure of a peasant, generally in wood, carrying on his back
a large basket, which edged with silver formed the drinking cup.
This type is only found in wine-growing districts, the basket
being used for carrying grapes. In Germany such cups are called
&ldquo;Buttenmann,&rdquo; in Switzerland &ldquo;Tanzenmann.&rdquo; The royal and
princely museums of Germany contain great numbers of such
vessels, the Green Vault in Dresden in particular, while a good
number are to be seen in our own great museums. A curious
fancy, combining instruction with conviviality, was to make cups
in the form of a globe, terrestrial or celestial, which are still useful
as showing the state of geographical or astronomical knowledge
at the time. Several of those made in the 16th century are still
in existence, one in the British Museum, a second at Nancy, and
others are in Copenhagen and Zurich and in private collections.
The upper half of the globe is removable, leaving the lower as
the drinking cup. Ivory both from the beauty of its colour and
the evenness of its structure has been a favourite material for
drinking vessels at all times, and would seem to have been
continuously used from the earliest period, whether derived from
Asia or Africa, while the semi-fossil mammoth ivory of Siberia
has not been neglected. In general, however, the vessels made
from this material presented no essential differences of form from
those in wood, until the art of lathe-turning attained great
perfection, when a wide field was opened for ingenuity and even
extravagance of form. The most remarkable examples of the
possibilities of this kind of mechanical skill are seen in the
productions of the Nuremberg turners of the 17th century, whose
elaborate and entirely useless <i>tours de force</i> comprise among many
other things standing cups of ivory sometimes 2 ft. high, exemplifying
every eccentricity of which the lathe is capable. Peter
Zick (d. 1632) and his three sons were celebrated for such work.
Several pieces, doubtless from their hands, are in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>The use of glass cups was not common in England until the
16th century, Venice having practically the monopoly of the
supply. A silver-mounted glass goblet which belonged
to the great Lord Burghley is, however, in the British
<span class="sidenote">Glass cups.</span>
Museum, where there is also a very large series of
Venetian drinking glasses of various kinds, clear and lace glass
as well as some of the 15th-century goblets with enamelled
designs, now of the greatest rarity. The relations of Venice with
the East were of so intimate a character that the earlier forms of
Venetian glasses were nearly identical with those of the Mahommedan
East.</p>

<p>A common type of Arab drinking glass resembled our modern
tumbler (a beaker), but gradually expanding in a curve towards
the mouth, and often enamelled. The enamelled designs were
at times related to the purpose of the vessel, figures drinking and
the like, but more commonly bore either a mark of ownership,
such as the armorial device of an emir, or some simple decorative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page584" id="page584"></a>584</span>
design. This simple form probably has its origin in the horn
cup made from the base of a cow&rsquo;s horn and closed at the smaller
end. The later forms in the late 15th century and after, followed
the fashion in other materials, and were raised on a tall foot,
so that from the 16th century onwards the type of wine glass
has hardly changed, except in details. An interesting variety
in one detail is seen in the German fashion of providing an
elaborate silver stand into which the foot of such an ordinary-shaped
glass was made to fit. Frequently, as might be expected,
such stands are found without glasses, and their use then seems
difficult to explain.</p>

<p>Another characteristic German type is the &ldquo;wiederkom,&rdquo; a
vessel more conspicuous for capacity than for its artistic qualities.
It is usually a cylindrical vessel of green glass often holding as
much as a quart, elaborately enamelled with coats of arms and
views of well-known places; and at times when the cup was a
wedding gift the figures of the bride and bridegroom are seen
upon it.</p>

<p>A very fanciful kind of cup was known in England as a &ldquo;yard
of ale,&rdquo; a long tube of glass generally shaped like a coach horn,
but ending sometimes in three prongs as a trident, the opening
in the latter being at the end of the handle, which was about a
yard in length.</p>

<p>Small silver cups were often made in dozens with various
devices, differing in each, such as the signs of the zodiac, the
occupations of the months, or figures of the classical gods and
goddesses, engraved upon them.</p>

<p>The tankard came into fashion in the 16th century, a practical,
but seldom graceful object. At first some attempt was made, by
shaping the sides, to attain to some artistic quality, but usually
the tankard from the late 16th century to the present time is
found with straight sides, either vertical or contracting towards
the top, which is of course always furnished with a hinged lid.</p>

<p>A material that has one obvious merit, that of being practically
unbreakable, is leather, and drinking cups were often made of it.
The flagon called a &ldquo;black jack&rdquo; is the best-known,
and examples are very common, mostly of the 17th
<span class="sidenote">17th and 18th century types.</span>
and 18th centuries. A quaint fashion was to have
a leather cup made in the form of a lady&rsquo;s shoe; this,
however, was confined to Germany and might be thought in
somewhat questionable taste.</p>

<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries a great impetus was given to
the production of curious drinking vessels in pottery. In England
at various potting centres a great number of cups called &ldquo;tygs&rdquo;
were made: capacious mugs with several handles, three or four,
round the sides, so that the cup could be readily passed from one
to the other. Many of these have quaint devices and inscriptions
upon them. Another favourite plan is to make a jug with open-work
round the neck and a variety of spouts, one only communicating
with the liquid. These &ldquo;puzzle jugs&rdquo; no doubt
caused a good deal of amusement when attempted by a novice,
who would inevitably spill some of the contents.</p>

<p>The horn of the rhinoceros is much favoured by the Chinese
as a material for drinking cups often of a somewhat archaic form.
The dense structure of the horn is well adapted for the purpose,
and its beautiful amber hue makes the vessel a very agreeable
object to the eye. The usual form is of a boat shape on a square
foot, and the carved decoration is often copied from that of the
bronze vessels of the earlier dynasties. Others are treated in a
freer and more naturalistic manner, the bowl being formed as
the flower of the magnolia, and the entire horn, at times more
than 2 ft. in length, is utilized in carrying out the design. One
of this kind is in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Cups of
the former type are commonly found imitated in ivory-white
porcelain, and are known as &ldquo;libation cups.&rdquo; Rhinoceros horn
is held by the Chinese to be an antidote against poison, a belief
shared by other nations.</p>

<p>There is but little to be said about the vessels used in the
drinking of tea and coffee. In Europe the type has practically
remained unchanged since the introduction of tea and coffee
drinking, except that in the 18th century the tea-cups imported
from China had no handles, and were generally thinner than the
<span class="sidenote">Tea and coffee cups.</span>
coffee cups. In Japan there is a ceremonious way of drinking
tea, known as <i>Cha no yu</i>. Here powdered green tea is used;
the party assembles in a small pavilion in a garden,
and the tea is made in accordance with a rigid etiquette.
The infusion is stirred with a whisk in a rudely
fashioned bowl, holding about a pint, and passed from
one guest to another. The bowls are of very thick pottery,
never of porcelain, and the most valued kind is that made in
Korea. In the drinking of rice spirit (saké) in Japan small wide
shallow cups are used, made generally of porcelain, but sometimes
of finely lacquered wood. Both kinds are usually ornamented
with elaborate and sometimes allusive designs.</p>

<p>Among savage races the most peculiar drinking ceremony is
that of kava drinking in Polynesia, principally in the Fijian,
Tongan and Samoan groups. The best description
of the process is given in Mariner&rsquo;s <i>Tonga</i>. The
<span class="sidenote">Savage utensils.</span>
principal vessel is usually a large bowl, sometimes
measuring 2 or 3 ft. in diameter, cut from a solid block of wood.
It has four short legs and an ear at one side to which a rope of
coco-nut fibre is generally attached. The liquid is prepared in
this bowl and ladled out in small cups often made of coco-nut
shells, and these are handed round with great ceremony. Both
the bowl and the cups become coated in the inside with a highly
polished layer, pale blue in colour; but this beautiful tint fades
when the vessel is out of use, and it is therefore very rarely seen
in specimens in Europe. The kava itself is prepared from the
root of a tree of the pepper family (<i>Piper methysticum</i>); the
root is cut into pieces of a convenient size, and these are given
to young men and women of the company, who masticate them,
and the lumps thus shredded are placed in the large bowl, water
is poured over them, and the mass is strained with great care by
wringing it in strips of the inner bark of the <i>hibiscus</i>. The liquor
is slightly intoxicating.</p>

<p>If the Polynesian method of preparing kava as a drink is
distasteful to our ideas, the favourite drinking bowl of the old
Tibetans is even more so. Friar Odoric (14th century), quoted
by Yule, describes how the Tibetan youth &ldquo;takes his father&rsquo;s
head and straightway cooks and eats it, and of the skull he makes
a goblet from which he and all his family always drink devoutly
to the memory of the deceased father.&rdquo; This recalls Livy&rsquo;s
account of the Boii in Upper Italy, who made a drinking vessel
of the head of the Roman consul Postumus. Among the
Tibetans skulls are still used, but generally for libations only;
for this purpose great care is exercised in the selection of the
skull, and the &ldquo;points&rdquo; of a good skull are well understood by
the Lamas.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRISLER, HENRY<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> (1818-1897), American classical scholar,
was born on the 27th of December 1818, on Staten Island, New
York. He graduated at Columbia College in 1839, taught classics
in the Columbia grammar school for four years, and was then
appointed tutor in classics in the college. In 1845 he became
adjunct professor of Latin and Greek there, in 1857 was appointed
to the new separate chair of Latin language and literature, and
ten years later succeeded Dr Charles Anthon as Jay professor
of Greek language and literature. He was acting president in
1867 and in 1888-1889, and from 1890 to his retirement as
professor emeritus in 1894 was dean of the school of arts. He
died in New York City on the 30th of November 1897. Dr
Drisler completed and supplemented Dr Anthon&rsquo;s labours as
an editor of classical texts. His criticisms and corrections of
Liddell and Scott&rsquo;s <i>Greek-English Lexicon</i>, of which he brought
out a revised American edition in 1846, won his name a place on
the title-page of the British edition in 1879, and in 1870 he

October 1846. He was educated at Winchester and New College,
Oxford, where he had a distinguished career, taking a first class
in Literae Humaniores in 1869. He was awarded the Pusey and
Ellerton scholarship in 1866, the Kennicott scholarship in 1870
(both Hebrew), and the Houghton Syriac prize in 1872. From
1870 he was a fellow, and from 1875 also a tutor, of New College,
and in 1883 succeeded Pusey as regius professor of Hebrew and
canon of Christ Church. He was a member of the Old Testament
Revision Committee (1876-1884) and examining chaplain to the
bishop of Southwell (1884-1904); received the honorary degrees
of doctor of literature of Dublin (1892), doctor of divinity of
Glasgow (1901), doctor of literature of Cambridge (1905); and
was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1902. Dr Driver

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRIVING<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> (from &ldquo;to drive,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> generally to propel, force
along or in, a word common in various forms to the Teutonic
languages), a word used in a restricted sense for the art of controlling
and directing draught animals from a coach or other
conveyance or movable machine to which they are harnessed
for the purpose of traction. This has been an occupation practised
since domesticated animals were first put to this use. In
various parts of the world a number of different animals have
been, and still are, so employed; of these the horse, ox, mule
and ass are the most common, though their place is taken by
the reindeer in northern latitudes, and by the Eskimo dog in
arctic and antarctic regions. The driving of each of these
requires special skill, only to be acquired by practice combined
with knowledge of the characteristics peculiar to the several
animals employed. The most accomplished driver of spirited
horses would probably be in difficulties if called upon to drive
sixteen or twenty dogs in an arctic sledge, or a team of oxen
or mules drawing the guns of a mountain battery; and the adept
in either of these branches of the art might provoke the compassion
of a farmer from Lincolnshire or Texas by his attempts
to manage a pair of Clydesdale horses in the plough or the
reaping machine.</p>

<p>Under all these different conditions driving is a work of
utility, of economic value to civilized society. But from very
early times driving, especially of horses, has also been regarded
as a sport or pastime. This probably arose in the first instance
from its association with battle. In the earliest historical
records, such as the Old Testament and the Homeric poems,
the driver of the chariot fills a place of importance in the economy
of war; and on his skill and efficiency the fate of kings, and even
of kingdoms, must often have depended. The statement in the
Book of Kings that Jehu the son of Nimshi was recognized from
a distance by his style of driving appears to indicate that the
warrior himself on occasion took the place of the professional
charioteer; and although it would be unsafe to infer from the
story that the pleasure derived from the occupation was his
motive for doing so, the name of this king of Israel has become
the eponym of drivers. Among the Greeks at an equally early
period driving was a recognized form of sport, to the popularity
of which Horace afterwards made allusion. Racing between
teams of horses harnessed to war-chariots took the place occupied
by saddle-horse racing and American trotting races (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Horse-Racing</a></span>)
in the sport of modern times. The element of danger
doubtless gave pleasurable excitement to chariot racing and
kept alive its association with incidents familiar in war; just
as at a later period, when the institution of chivalry had given
the armed knight on horseback a conspicuous place in medieval
warfare, the tournament became the most popular sport of the
aristocracy throughout Europe.</p>

<p>This element of danger cannot be said to enter usually into
the enjoyment of driving at the present day. Though accidents
occasionally happen, the pastime is practically unattended by
serious risk; and the source of the pleasure it affords the driver
must be sought in the skill it requires, combined with the love
of the horse which is common to sportsmen, and of exercise of
power. The art of driving as practised to-day for pleasure
without profit, and without the excitement of racing, is of quite
modern development. Oliver Cromwell, indeed, met with a
mishap in Hyde Park while driving a team of four horses presented
to him by the count of Oldenburg, which was the subject
of more than one satirical allusion by contemporary royalist
writers; but two things were needed before much enjoyment
could be found in driving apart from utility. These were the
invention of carriages on springs, and the construction of roads
with smooth and solid surface. The former did not come into
general use till near the end of the 18th century, and it was
about the same period that the engineering skill of Thomas
Telford and the invention of John London Macadam combined
to provide the latter. The influence on driving of these two
developments was soon apparent. Throughout the 18th century
stage-coaches, ponderous unwieldy vehicles without springs,
had toiled slowly over rough and deeply rutted tracks as a
means of communication between different parts of Great
Britain; but those who made use of them did so as a matter
of necessity and not for enjoyment. But by the beginning
of the 19th century the improvement in carriage-building
and road-construction alike had greatly diminished the discomfort
of travel; and interest in driving for its own sake grew
so rapidly that in 1807 the first association of amateur coachmen
was formed. This was the Bensington Driving Club, the forerunner
of many aristocratic clubs for gentlemen interested in
driving as a pastime.</p>

<p>In modern driving one, two or four horses are usually employed.
When a greater number than four is put in harness, as
in the case of the state equipages of royal personages on occasions
of ceremony, the horses are not driven but are controlled by
&ldquo;postillions&rdquo; mounted on the near-side horse of each pair.
When two horses are used they may either be placed side by
side, in &ldquo;double harness,&rdquo; which is the commoner mode of driving
a pair of horses, or one following the other, in a &ldquo;tandem.&rdquo;
Four horses, or &ldquo;four-in-hand,&rdquo; are harnessed in two pairs,
one following the other, and called respectively the &ldquo;leaders&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;wheelers&rdquo;&mdash;the same terms being used for the two
horses of a tandem.</p>

<p>Though it is a less difficult accomplishment to drive a single
horse than a tandem or four-in-hand, or even a pair, it nevertheless
requires both knowledge and the skill that practice alone
confers. The driver should have some knowledge of equine
character, and complete familiarity with every part of the
harness he uses, and with the purpose which each buckle or
strap is intended to serve. The indefinable quality known
in horsemanship as &ldquo;good hands&rdquo; is scarcely less desirable
on the box-seat than in the saddle. It is often said to be unattainable
by those who do not possess it by nature; but though
this may be true to some extent, &ldquo;good hands&rdquo; are partly at
least the result of learning the correct position for the arm and
hand that holds the reins. The reins are held in the left hand,
which should be kept at about the level of the lowest button
of the driver&rsquo;s waistcoat, and near the body though not pressed
against it. The driving hand should never be reached forward
more than a few inches, nor raised as high as the breast. The
upper arm should lie loosely against the side, the forearm horizontal
across the front of the body, forming a right angle or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page586" id="page586"></a>586</span>
thereabouts at the elbow-joint, the wrist very slightly bent inwards,
and the back of the hand and knuckles facing outwards
towards the horses. In this position the three joints of the arm
form a kind of automatic spring that secures the &ldquo;give&rdquo; to the
movement of the horse&rsquo;s mouth which, in conjunction with
firmness, is a large part of what is meant by &ldquo;good hands.&rdquo;
But this result is only obtained if the reins be also held with
the proper degree of bearing on the bit. What the proper degree
may be depends greatly on the character of the horses and the
severity of the bit. Pulling horses must be restrained by a
strong draw on their bits, such as would bring other animals
to a standstill. But under no circumstances, no matter how
sluggish the horses may be, should the reins be allowed to lie
slack; for if this is done the horse receives no support in the
event of a sudden stumble, and no control if he shies unexpectedly.
The driver should therefore always just &ldquo;feel his
horse&rsquo;s mouth&rdquo; as lightly as possible; he then has the animal
well under control in readiness for every emergency, while
avoiding such a pull on the mouth as would cause a high-spirited
horse to chafe and fret. Well-broken carriage horses should
always be willing to run into their bits, and those that draw
back when lightly held in hand should be kept up to the bit
with the whip.</p>

<p>These principles are common to all branches of the art of
driving, whether of one, two or four horses. When they are
observed no great difficulty confronts the coachman who is
content with single or double harness, provided he has acquired
the eye for pace and distance, and the instinctive realization
of the length of the carriage behind him, without which he may
suffer collision with other vehicles, or allow insufficient room in
turning a corner or entering a gateway. For before he can have
had the practice by which alone this knowledge is to be gained,
the beginner will have learnt such elementary facts as that his
horses must be held well in hand going down hill and given
their heads on an ascent, and that on no account should the
horse&rsquo;s mouth be &ldquo;jobbed&rdquo; by the driver jerking the reins;
he will also have learnt a good deal about the character and
temperament of the horse, on which so much of the art of driving
depends, and which can best be studied on the box-seat and
not at all in the library. If he has pursued this study with any
degree of insight, he will have learnt further to be sparing in
the use of the hand-brake with which most modern carriages are
provided. This apparatus is most useful in case of emergency,
or for taking weight off the carriage on a really steep descent;
but the habit which too many coachmen fall into of using the
brake on every trifling decline should be avoided. Its effect
is that the horses are continually doing collar-work, and are
thus deprived of the relief which ought to be given them by
occasional light pole or shaft work instead.</p>

<p>When the ambition of the amateur coachman leads him to
attempt a tandem or four-in-hand he enters on a much more
complex department of the art of driving. In the
first place he has now four reins instead of two to
<span class="sidenote">Tandem and four-in-hand.</span>
manipulate, and the increase of weight on his hand,
especially when four horses are being driven, requires
considerable strength of wrist to support it without tiring. It is
of the first importance, moreover, that he should know instinctively
the position in his hand of each of the reins, and be able
automatically and instantaneously to lay a finger on any one of
them. The driver who has to look at his reins to find the off-side
leader&rsquo;s rein, or who touches the near-side wheeler&rsquo;s in mistake
for it, is in peril of a catastrophe. It is therefore essential that
the reins should be correctly disposed between the fingers of
the left hand, and that the driver should as quickly as possible
accustom himself to handle them automatically. This is somewhat
more difficult in driving tandem than in driving four-in-hand,
because in the latter case there is greater spread of the
reins in front of the hand than with tandem, where the reins lie
much more nearly parallel one above the other. The actual
holding of the reins is the same in both cases. The coachman
should be careful to take the reins in his hand before mounting
to the box-seat, as otherwise his team may make a start without
his having the means to control them. It is customary to hitch
the reins, ready for him to take them, on the outside terret (the
ring on the pad through which the rein runs) of the wheeler&mdash;the
off-side wheeler in four-in-hand. Standing on the ground
beside the off-side wheel of his carriage, ready to mount to the
box-seat, the coachman, after drawing up his reins till he almost
feels the horses&rsquo; mouths, must then let out about a foot of slack
in his off-side reins, in order that when on his seat he may find
all the reins as nearly as possible equal in length in his hand.
He mounts with them disposed in his right hand precisely as they
will be in his left when ready to start. The leaders&rsquo; reins should
be separated by the forefinger, and the wheelers&rsquo; by the middle
finger. The near-leader&rsquo;s rein will then be uppermost of the
four, between the forefinger and thumb; then between the
forefinger and middle finger are two reins together&mdash;the off-leader&rsquo;s
and the near-wheeler&rsquo;s in the order named; while at
the bottom, between the middle and third fingers, is the off-wheeler&rsquo;s
rein. It will be found that held thus the reins spread
immediately in front of the hand in such a way that each several
rein, and each pair of reins&mdash;two near-side, two off-side, two
wheelers&rsquo; or two leaders&rsquo;&mdash;can be conveniently manipulated;
and the proficient driver can instinctively and instantaneously
grasp any of them he chooses with his right hand without having
to turn his eyes from the road before him to the reins in his hand.
Having seated himself on the box and transferred the reins, thus
disposed, from the right to the left hand, the coachman should
shorten them till he just feels his wheelers&rsquo; mouths and holds
back his leaders sufficiently to prevent them quite tightening
their traces; then, when he has taken the whip from its socket
in his right hand, he is ready to start. This is an operation
requiring careful management, to secure that leaders and
wheelers start simultaneously; for if the leaders start first they
will be drawn up sharp by their bits, or, what is worse, if their
reins have not been sufficiently shortened they will jump into
their collars and possibly break a swinging bar, and in either case
they will be fretted and disconcerted and will possibly in consequence
either kick or rear; if the wheelers start before the
leaders they will ram the swinging bars under the tails of the
latter, with results equally unfortunate. The worst possible
method of starting is suddenly to give the horses their heads and
use the whip. But no positive rule can be laid down, for it is
just one of those points which depend largely on familiarity
with the horses forming the team. Horses even moderately
accustomed to the work will generally start best in obedience
to the voice, and their attention may simultaneously be aroused
by gently feeling their mouths. When once started the driver
should at once see that his team is going straight. If the leaders
and wheelers are not exactly on the same line, this or that rein
must be shortened or lengthened as the case may require; and
it is to be noticed that as the near-wheeler&rsquo;s and off-leader&rsquo;s
reins lie together between the same fingers, a simultaneous
shortening or lengthening of these two reins will usually produce
the desired result. With rare exceptions, reins should be
shortened or lengthened by pushing them back or drawing them
forward with the right hand from in front of the driving hand,
and not from behind it. As soon as the team is in motion the
leaders may be let out till they draw their traces taut; but
draught should be taken off them on falling ground or while
rounding a corner. Good drivers touch the reins as little as
possible with the whip-hand, and nothing is less workmanlike
than for a coachman to act as if he were an angler continually
letting out or reeling in his line. In rounding a corner a loop of
an inch or two of the leaders&rsquo; rein on the side to which the turn
is to be made is taken up by the right hand and placed under
the left thumb. This &ldquo;points the leaders,&rdquo; who accordingly
make the required turn, while at the same time the right hand
bears lightly on the wheelers&rsquo; rein of the opposite side, to prevent
them making the turn too sharply for safety to the coach behind
them. As soon as the turn is made&mdash;and all this applies equally
to the passing of other vehicles or obstacles on the road&mdash;the
driver&rsquo;s left thumb releases the loop, which runs out of itself,
and the team returns to the straight formation. A circumstance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page587" id="page587"></a>587</span>
useful to bear in mind is that the swinging bars are wider than
the maximum width of the coach; consequently the driver
knows that wherever the swinging bars can pass through with
safety&mdash;and as they are before his eyes the calculation is easy&mdash;the
coach will safely follow.</p>

<p>A necessary part of driving four horses or tandem is the proper
use of the whip. The novice, before beginning to drive, should
acquire the knack&mdash;which can only be learnt by
practical instruction and experiment&mdash;of catching
<span class="sidenote">The use of the whip.</span>
up the thong of the whip on to the stick by a flick
of the wrist. With practice this is done almost automatically
and without looking at the whip. It is not merely an ornamental
accomplishment, but a necessary one; for in no other way can
the whip be kept in constant readiness for use either on wheelers
or leaders as the need of the moment may dictate. The point
of the thong is confined in the whip-hand when striking the
wheelers (which should be done in front of the pad), and is
released for reaching the leaders. Considerable dexterity is
required in using the whip on the leaders without at the same
time touching, or at all events alarming or fretting, the wheelers.
The thong of the whip should reach the leaders from beneath
the swinging bar; and proficient &ldquo;whips&rdquo; can unerringly strike
even the near leader from under the off-side bar without disturbing
the equanimity of any other member of the team. This
demands great skill and accuracy; but no coachman is competent
to drive four horses until he is able to touch with the whip any
particular horse that may require it, and no other.</p>

<p>Essential as is proficiency in the use of the whip when driving
four horses, it is even more imperative for the driver of tandem.
For in four-in-hand the leaders act in some measure as a restraint
upon each other&rsquo;s freedom of action, whereas the leader in
tandem is entirely independent and therefore more difficult to
control. If he takes it into his head to turn completely round
and face the driver, there is no effectual means of preventing
him. It is here that a prompt and accurate use of the whip is
important. A sharp cut with the thong of the whip on the side
to which he is turning will often drive the leader back into his
place. But it must be done instantaneously, and the driver
who has got his thong coiled round the stick of his whip, or who
cannot make certain of striking the horse on precisely the
desired spot, will miss the opportunity and may find his team
in a sad mess, possibly with disastrous results. If the leader,
in spite of a stroke from the whip at the right moment and on the
right spot, still persists in turning, the only thing to be done is
to turn the wheeler also; and then when the tandem has been
straightened, to turn the horses back once more to their original
direction. For this reason it is never safe to harness a tandem
to a four-wheeled vehicle; because if it should be necessary to
turn the wheeler sharply round, the fore-carriage would probably
lock and the trap be overturned. Of comparatively recent years
a great improvement has been effected in the harnessing of a
tandem by the introduction of swinging bars similar to those
used in four-in-hand. Formerly the leading traces in tandem
drew direct from tugs on the wheeler&rsquo;s hames, or less frequently
from the stops on the shafts. This left a considerable length
of trace which, when draught was taken off the leader, hung
slack between the two horses; with the result that either of
them might get a leg over the leading trace, with dangerous
consequences. In the more modern arrangement short traces
attached to the wheeler&rsquo;s tugs hold a bar, which is kept in place
by a few inches of chain from the kidney-link on the wheeler&rsquo;s
collar. This bar is connected by short traces or chains with
a second bar to which the leader&rsquo;s true traces are hooked in the
usual way, allowing him a comfortable distance clear of the bar
precisely as in four-in-hand. The leader thus draws as before
from the wheeler&rsquo;s tugs; but the length of trace is broken up
by the two swinging bars, and as these are prevented from
falling low by their attachment to the wheeler&rsquo;s collar, the
danger from a too slack leading trace is reduced to a minimum;
though care is needed when the leader is not pulling to prevent
the bar falling on his hocks.</p>

<p>Expert tandem driving, owing to the greater freedom of the
leader from control, is a more difficult art than the driving of
four horses, in spite of the fact that the weight on the hand is
much less severe; but the general principles of the two are the
same. In Great Britain, however, the coach-and-four is the more
popular. It is more showy than tandem; it keeps alive the
romantic associations of the days when the stagecoach was the
ordinary means of locomotion; and a coach, or &ldquo;drag,&rdquo; accommodates
a larger party of passengers to a race-meeting or other
expedition for pleasure than a dogcart. But for those whose
means do not permit the more costly luxury of a four-horse
team, a tandem will be found to make all the demand on skill
and nerve which, in combination with the taste for horses,
makes the art of driving a source of enjoyment.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DROGHEDA<a name="ar39" id="ar39"></a></span>, a municipal borough, seaport and market town,
on the southern border of Co. Louth, Ireland, in the south
parliamentary division, on the river Boyne, about 4 m. from its
mouth in Drogheda Bay, and 31½ m. N. by W. from Dublin on
the Great Northern main line. Pop. (1901) 12,760. It occupies
both banks of the river; but the northern division is the larger
of the two, and has received greater attention in modern times.
The ancient fortifications, still extant in the beginning of the
19th century, have disappeared almost entirely, but of the four
gateways one named after St Lawrence remains nearly perfect,
consisting of two loopholed circular towers; and there are
considerable ruins of another, the West or Butler Gate. Among
the public buildings are a mansion-house or mayoralty, with a
suite of assembly rooms attached; and the Tholsel, a square
building with a cupola. St Peter&rsquo;s chapel formerly served as
the cathedral of the Roman Catholic archbishopric of Armagh;
and in the abbey of the Dominican nuns there is still preserved
the head of Oliver Plunkett, the archbishop who was executed
at Tyburn in 1681 on an unfounded charge of treason. There
was formerly an archiepiscopal palace in the town, built by
Archbishop Hampton about 1620; and the Dominicans, the
Franciscans, the Augustinians, the Carmelites and the knights
of St John have monastic establishments. Of the Dominican
monastery (1224) there still exists the stately Magdalen tower;
while of the Augustinian abbey of St Mary d&rsquo;Urso (1206) there
are the tower and a fine pointed arch. At the head of the educational
institutions there is a classical school endowed by Erasmus
Smith. There is also a blue-coat school, founded about 1727
for the education of freemen&rsquo;s sons. The present building was
erected in 1870. Benjamin Whitworth, M.P., was a generous
benefactor to the town, who built the Whitworth Hall, furnished
half the funds for the construction of waterworks, established
a cotton factory, and is commemorated by a statue in the Mall.
The industrial establishments comprise cotton, flax and flour
mills, sawmills, tanneries, salt and soap works, breweries,
chemical manure and engineering works. The town is the
headquarters of the valuable Boyne salmon-fishery. A brisk
trade is carried on mainly in agricultural produce, especially
with Liverpool (which is distant 135 m. due E.) and with Glasgow.
Many works of improvement have been effected from time to
time in the harbour, the quays of which occupy both sides of the
river, the principal, 1000 yds. in length, being on the north side.
Here is a depth of 21 ft. at the highest and 14 ft. at the lowest
tides. The tide reaches 2½ m. above the town to Oldbridge;
and barges of 50 tons burden can proceed 19 m. inland to Navan.
The river is crossed by a bridge for ordinary traffic, and by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page588" id="page588"></a>588</span>
fine railway viaduct. The town is governed by a mayor, 6
aldermen and 18 councillors.</p>

<p>In the earliest notices the town of Drogheda is called Inver-Colpa
or the Port of Colpa; the present name signifies &ldquo;The
Bridge over the Ford.&rdquo; In 1152 the place is mentioned as the
seat of a synod convened by the papal legate, Cardinal Paparo;
in 1224 it was chosen by Lucas de Netterville, archbishop of
Armagh, for the foundation of the Dominican friary of which
there are still remains; and in 1228 the two divisions of the
town received separate incorporation from Henry III. But
there grew up a strong feeling of hostility between Drogheda
<i>versus Uriel</i> and Drogheda <i>versus Midiam</i>, in consequence of
trading vessels lading their cargoes in the latter or southern
town, to avoid the pontage duty levied in the former or northern
town. At length, after much blood had been shed in the dispute,
Philip Bennett, a monk residing in the town, succeeded by his
eloquence, on the festival of Corpus Christi, 1412, in persuading
the authorities of the two corporations to send to Henry IV.
for a new charter sanctioning their combination, and this was
granted on the 1st of November. Drogheda was always considered
by the English a place of much importance. In the reign
of Edward III. it was classed along with Dublin, Waterford and
Kilkenny as one of the four staple towns of Ireland. Richard II.
received in its Dominican monastery the submissions of O&rsquo;Neal,
O&rsquo;Donnell and other chieftains of Ulster and Leinster. The
right of coining money was bestowed on the town, and parliaments
were several times held within its walls. In the reign
of Edward IV. the mayor received a sword of state and an
annuity of £20, in recognition of the services rendered by the
inhabitants at Malpus Bridge against O&rsquo;Reilly; the still greater
honour of having a university with the same privileges as that
of Oxford remained a mere paper distinction, owing to the
poverty of the town and the unsettled state of the country;
and an attempt made by the corporation in modern times to
resuscitate their rights proved unsuccessful. In 1495 Poyning&rsquo;s
laws were enacted by a parliament held in the town. In the
civil wars of 1641 the place was besieged by O&rsquo;Neal and the
Northern Irish forces; but it was gallantly defended by Sir
Henry Tichbourne, and after a long blockade was relieved by
the Marquess of Ormond. The same nobleman relieved it a
second time, when it was invested by the Parliamentary army
under Colonel Jones. In 1649 it was captured by Cromwell,
after a short though spirited defence; and nearly every individual
within its walls, without distinction of age or sex, was put to
the sword. Thirty only escaped, who were afterwards transported
as slaves to Barbados. In 1690 it was garrisoned by
King James&rsquo;s army; but after the decisive battle of the Boyne
(<i>q.v.</i>) it surrendered to the conqueror without a struggle, in
consequence of a threat that quarter would not be granted if
the town were taken by storm.</p>

<p>Drogheda ceased to be a parliamentary borough in 1885,
and a county of a town in 1898. Before 1885 it returned one
member, and before the Union in 1800 it returned four members
to the Irish parliament.</p>

<p>From the close of the 12th century, certainly long before the
Reformation and for some time after it, the primates of Ireland
lived in Drogheda. Being mostly Englishmen, they preferred
to reside in the portion of their diocese within the gate, and
Drogheda, being a walled town, was less liable to attack from
the natives. From 1417 onwards Drogheda was their chief
place of residence and of burial. Its proximity to Dublin, the
seat of government and of the Irish parliament, in which the
primates were such prominent figures, induced them to prefer
it to <i>Ardmacha inter Hibernicos</i>. Archbishop O&rsquo;Scanlain, who
did much in the building of the cathedral at Armagh, preferred
to live at Drogheda, and there he was buried in 1270. Near
Drogheda in later times was the primates&rsquo; castle and summer
palace at Termonfeckin, some ruins of which remain. In
Drogheda itself there is now not a vestige of the palace, except
the name &ldquo;Palace Street.&rdquo; It stood at the corner of the main
street near St Lawrence&rsquo;s gate, and its grounds extended back
to St Peter&rsquo;s church. The primates of the 15th century were
buried in or near Drogheda. After the Reformation five in
succession lived in Drogheda and there were buried, though
there is now nothing to fix the spot where any of them lies. The
last of these&mdash;Christopher Hampton&mdash;who was consecrated to
the primacy in 1613, repaired the ruined cathedral of Armagh.
He built a new and handsome palace at Drogheda, and he
repaired the old disused palace at Armagh and bestowed on it a
demesne of 300 acres.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DROITWICH,<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> a market town and municipal borough in the
Droitwich parliamentary division of Worcestershire, England,
5½ m. N.N.E. of Worcester, and 126 m. N.W. by W. from London
by the Great Western railway. Pop. (1901) 4201. It is served
by the Bristol-Birmingham line of the Midland railway, and by
the Worcester-Shrewsbury line of the Great Western. It stands
on the river Salwarpe, an eastern tributary of the Severn. There
is connexion with the Severn by canal. There are three parish
churches, St Andrew, St Peter and St Michael, of which the two
first are fine old buildings in mixed styles, while St Michael&rsquo;s
is modern. The principal occupation is the manufacture of the
salt obtained from the brine springs or <i>wyches</i>, to which the
town probably owes both its name and its origin. The springs
also give Droitwich a considerable reputation as a health resort.
There are Royal Brine baths, supplied with water of extreme
saltness, St Andrew&rsquo;s baths, and a private bath hospital. The
water is used in cases of gout, rheumatism and kindred diseases.
Owing to the pumping of the brine for the salt-works there is a
continual subsidence of the ground, detrimental to the buildings,
and new houses are mostly built in the suburbs. In the pleasant
well-wooded district surrounding Droitwich the most noteworthy
points are Hindlip Hall, 3 m. S., where (in a former mansion)
some of the conspirators in the Gunpowder Plot defied search
for eight days (1605); and Westwood, a fine hall of Elizabethan
and Carolean date on the site of a Benedictine nunnery, a mile
west of Droitwich, which offered a retreat to many Royalist
cavaliers and churchmen during the Commonwealth. Droitwich
is governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area,
1856 acres.</p>

<p>A Roman villa, with various relics, has been discovered here,
but it is doubtful how far the Romans made use of the brine
springs. Droitwich (<i>Wic</i>, <i>Salturic</i>, <i>Wich</i>) probably owed its
origin to the springs, which are mentioned in several charters
before the Conquest. At the time of the Domesday Survey all
the salt springs belonged to the king, who received from them a
yearly farm of £65, but the manor was divided between several
churches and tenants-in-chief. The burgesses of Droitwich are
mentioned in the Domesday Survey, but they probably only
had certain franchises in connexion with the salt trade. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page589" id="page589"></a>589</span>
town is first called a borough in the pipe roll of 2 Henry II.,
when an aid of 20s. was paid, but the burgesses did not receive
their first charter until 1215, when King John granted them
freedom from toll throughout the kingdom and the privilege of
holding the town at a fee-farm of £100. The burgesses appear
to have had much difficulty in paying this large farm; in 1227
the king pardoned twenty-eight marks of the thirty-two due as
tallage, while in 1237 they were £23 in arrears for the farm.
They continued, however, to pay the farm until the payment
gradually lapsed in the 18th century. In medieval times
Droitwich was governed by two bailiffs and twelve jurats, the
former being elected every year by the burgesses; Queen Mary
granted the incorporation charter in 1554 under the name of
the bailiffs and burgesses. James I. in 1625 granted another
and fuller charter, which remained the governing charter until
the Municipal Reform Act. King John&rsquo;s charter granted the
burgesses a fair on the feast of SS. Andrew and Nicholas lasting
for eight days, but Edward III. in 1330 granted instead two fairs
on the vigil and day of St Thomas the Martyr and the vigil and
day of SS. Simon and Jude. Queen Mary granted three new
fairs, and James I. changed the market day from Monday
to Friday.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRÔME,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> a department in the south-east of France, formed of
parts of Dauphiné and Provence, and bounded W. by the Rhone,
which separates it from Ardèche, N. and N.E. by Isère, E. by
Hautes-Alpes, S.E. by Basses-Alpes, and S. by Vaucluse;
area 2533 sq. m.; pop. (1906) 297,270. Drôme is traversed
from east to west by numerous rivers of the Rhone basin, chief
among which are the Isère in the north, the Drôme in the centre
and the Aygues in the south. The left bank of the Rhone is
bordered by alluvial plains and low hills, but to the east of this
zone the department is covered to the extent of two-thirds of
its surface by spurs of the Alps, sloping down towards the west.
To the north of the Drôme lie the Vercors and the Royans, a
region of forest-clad ridges running uniformly north and south.
South of that river the mountain system is broken, irregular and
intersected everywhere by torrents. The most easterly portion
of the department, where it touches the mountains of the
Dévoluy, contains its culminating summit (7890 ft.). North
of the Isère stretches a district of low hills terminating on the
limits of the department in the Valloire, its most productive
portion. The climate, except in the valleys bordering the
Rhone, is cold, and winds blow incessantly. Snow is visible
on the mountain-tops during the greater part of the year.</p>

<p>The agriculture of the department is moderately prosperous.
The main crops are wheat, which is grown chiefly on the banks
of the Isère and Rhone, oats and potatoes. Large flocks of sheep
feed on the pastures in the south; cattle-raising is carried on
principally in the north-east. Good wines, among which the
famous Hermitage growth ranks first, are grown on the hills and
plains near the Rhone and Drôme. Fruit culture is much
practised. Olives and figs are grown in the south; the cultivation
of mulberries and walnuts is more widely spread. In the
rearing of silkworms Drôme ranks high in importance among
French departments. The Montélimar district is noted for its
truffles, which are also found elsewhere in the department.
The mineral products of Drôme include lignite, blende, galena,
calamine, freestone, lime, cement, potter&rsquo;s clay and kaolin.
Brick and tile works, potteries and porcelain manufactories
exist in several localities. The industries comprise flour-milling,
distilling, wood-sawing, turnery and dyeing. The chief textile
industry is the preparation and weaving of silk, which is carried
on in a number of towns. Woollen and cotton goods are also
manufactured. Leather working and boot-making, which are
carried on on a large scale at Romans, are important, and the
manufacture of machinery, hats, confectionery and paper
employs much labour. Drôme exports fruit, oil, cheese, wine,
wool, live stock and its manufactured articles; the chief import
is coal. It is served by the Paris-Lyon railway, and the Rhone
and Isère furnish over 100 m. of navigable waterway. The canal
de la Bourne, the only one in the department, is used for purposes
of irrigation only. Drôme is divided into the arrondissements
of Valence, Die, Montélimar and Nyons, comprising 29 cantons
and 379 communes. The capital is Valence, which is the seat of
a bishopric of the province of Avignon. The department forms
part of the académie (educational division) of Grenoble, where
its court of appeal is also located, and of the region of the
XIV. army corps.</p>

<p>Besides Valence, the chief towns of the department are Die,
Montélimar, Crest and Romans (<i>qq.v.</i>). Nyons is a small industrial
town with a medieval bridge and remains of ramparts. Suze-la-Rousse
is dominated by a fine château with fortifications of the
12th and 14th centuries; in the interior the buildings are in
the Renaissance style. At St Donat there are remains of the
palace of the kings of Cisjuran Burgundy; though but little of
the building is of an earlier date than the 12th century, it is the
oldest example of civil architecture in France. The churches of
Léoncel, St Restitut and La Garde-Adhémar, all of Romanesque
architecture, are also of antiquarian interest. St Paul-Trois-Châteaux,
an old Roman town, once the seat of a bishopric,
has a Romanesque cathedral. At Grignan there are remains
of the Renaissance château where Madame de Sévigné died.
At Tain there is a sacrificial altar of <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 184.</p>

a bishopric, which grew out of an abbey of Canons Regular
attributed to St Colman in the 6th century, and was united in
1842 to Down and Connor. The town and cathedral were wholly
destroyed during the insurrection of 1641, and the present church
was built by Bishop Jeremy Taylor in 1661, who is buried here,
as also is Thomas Percy, another famous bishop of the diocese,
who laid out the fine grounds of the palace. Remains of a castle
and earthworks are to be seen, together with a large rath or

<p><span class="bold">DRONE,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> in music<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (corresponding to Fr. <i>bourdon</i>; Ger.
<i>Summer</i>, <i>Stimmer</i>, <i>Hummel</i>; Ital. <i>bordone</i>), the bass pipe or
pipes of the bagpipe, having no lateral holes and therefore giving
out the same note without intermission as long as there is wind
in the bag, thus forming a continuous pedal, or drone bass.
The drone consists of a jointed pipe having a cylindrical bore and
usually terminating in a bell. During the middle ages bagpipes
are represented in miniatures with conical drones,<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a> and M.
Praetorius<a name="fa3d" id="fa3d" href="#ft3d"><span class="sp">3</span></a> gives a drawing of a bagpipe, which he calls <i>Grosser
Bock</i>, having two drones ending in a curved ram&rsquo;s horn. The
drone pipe has, instead of a mouthpiece, a socket fitted with
a reed, and inserted into a stock or short pipe immovably fixed
in an aperture of the bag. The reed is of the kind known as
beating reed or <i>squeaker</i>, prepared by making a cut in the direction
of the circumference of the pipe and splitting back the reed from
the cut towards a joint or knot, thus leaving a flap or tongue
which vibrates or beats, alternately opening and closing the
aperture. The sound is produced by the stream of air forced
from the bag by the pressure of the performer&rsquo;s arm causing the
reed tongue to vibrate over the aperture, thus setting the whole
column of air in vibration. Like all cylindrical pipes with reed
mouthpiece, the drone pipe has the acoustic properties of the
closed pipe and produces a note of the same pitch as that of an
open pipe twice its length. The conical drones mentioned above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page590" id="page590"></a>590</span>
would, therefore, speak an octave higher than a cylindrical
drone of the same length. The drones are tuned by means of
sliding tubes at the joints.</p>

<p>The drones of the old French <i>cornemuse</i> played in concert
with the <i>hautbois de Poitou</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bagpipe</a></span>), and differing from
the shepherd&rsquo;s <i>cornemuse</i> or <i>chalémie</i>, formed an exception to
this method of construction, being furnished with double reeds
like that of the oboe. The drones of the musette and of the
union pipes of Ireland are also constructed on an altogether
different plan. Instead of having long cumbersome pipes,
pointing over the shoulder, the musette drones consist of a short
barrel containing lengths of tubing necessary for four or five
drones, reduced to the most compact form and resembling the
rackett (<i>q.v.</i>). The narrow bores are pierced longitudinally
through the thickness of the barrel in parallel channels communicating
with each other in twos or threes, and so arranged as to
provide the requisite length for each drone. The reeds are double
reeds all set in the wooden stock within the bag. By means
of regulating slides (called in English <i>regulators</i> and in French
<i>layettes</i>), which may be pushed up and down in longitudinal
grooves round the circumference of the barrel, the length of
each drone tube can be so regulated that a simple harmonic
bass consisting of the common chord is obtainable. In the
union pipes the drones are separate pipes having keys played
by the elbow, which correspond to the sliders in the musette
drone and produce the same kind of harmonic bass. The modern
Egyptian arghool consists of a kind of clarinet with a drone
attached to it by means of waxed thread; in this case the
beating reed of the drone is set in vibration directly by the
breath of the performer, who takes both mouthpieces into his
mouth, without the medium of a wind reservoir. Mersenne
gave very clear descriptions of the construction of cornemuse
and musette, with clear illustrations of the reeds and stock.<a name="fa4d" id="fa4d" href="#ft4d"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
There are allusions in the Greek classics which point to the
existence of a pipe with a drone, either of the arghool or the
bagpipe type.<a name="fa5d" id="fa5d" href="#ft5d"><span class="sp">5</span></a></p>

<p><span class="bold">DRONFIELD,<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> an urban district in the north-eastern parliamentary
division of Derbyshire, England, 6 m. S. of Sheffield,
on the Midland railway. Pop. (1901) 3809. It lies on the small
river Drone, a tributary of the Rother, in a busy industrial
district in which are numerous coal-mines, and there are iron

<p><span class="bold">DROPSY<a name="ar48" id="ar48"></a></span> (contracted from the old word <i>hydropisy</i>, derived
from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="udrôps">&#8021;&#948;&#961;&#969;&#968;</span>; <span class="grk" title="udôr">&#8021;&#948;&#969;&#961;</span>, water, and <span class="grk" title="ôps">&#8036;&#968;</span>, appearance), the
name given to a collection of simple serous fluid in all or any of
the cavities of the body, or in the meshes of its tissues. Dropsy
of the subcutaneous connective tissue is termed <i>oedema</i> when
it is localized and limited in extent; when more diffuse it is
termed <i>anasarca</i>; the term <i>oedema</i> is also applied to dropsies
of some of the internal organs, notably to that of the lungs.
<i>Hydrocephalus</i> signifies an accumulation of fluid within the
ventricles of the brain or in the arachnoid cavity; <i>hydrothorax</i>,
a collection of fluid in one or both pleural cavities; <i>hydropericardium</i>,
in the pericardium; <i>ascites</i>, in the peritoneum; and,
when <i>anasarca</i> is conjoined with the accumulation of fluid in
one or more of the serous cavities, the dropsy is said to be
general (see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pathology</a></span>).</p>

<p>Dropsy (excluding &ldquo;epidemic dropsy,&rdquo; for which see below)
is essentially a symptom and not a specific disease, and is merely
an exaggeration of a certain state of health. Fluid, known as
lymph, is continually passing through the capillary walls into
the tissues, and in health this is removed as fast as it is exuded,
in one or more of three ways: part of it is used in the nutrition
of the tissues, part is returned to the general circulation by the
veins, and part by the lymphatics. Any accumulation constitutes
dropsy and is a sign of disease, though not a disease in
itself. The serous effusions due to inflammation are not included
under the term dropsy. A dropsical fluid varies considerably in
composition according to its position in the body, but varies
only slightly according to the disease which has given rise to
it. Its specific gravity ranges between 1008 and 1018; the
mineral salts present are the same and in about the same proportion
as those of blood, nor do they vary with the position of
the exudation. The quantity of albumin, however, depends much
on the position of the fluid, and slightly on the underlying
disease. In oedema the fluid contains only traces, whereas a
pleural or peritoneal effusion is always highly albuminous.
Also an effusion due to heart disease contains more albumin
than one due to kidney disease. In appearance it may be
colourless, greenish or reddish from the presence of blood pigment,
or yellowish from the presence of bile pigment; transparent or
opalescent or milky from the presence of fatty matter derived
from the chyle. The membrane from which the dropsical fluid
escapes is healthy, or at least not inflamed, and only somewhat
sodden by long contact with the fluid&mdash;the morbid condition
on which the transudation depends lying elsewhere.</p>

<p>The simplest cause of dropsy is purely mechanical, blood
pressure being raised beyond a certain point owing to venous
obstruction. This may be due to thrombosis of a vein as in
phlegmasia dolens (white leg), retardation of venous circulation
as in varicose veins, or obstruction of a vein due to the pressure
of an aneurism or tumour. Cardiac and renal dropsy are more
complicated in origin, but cardiac dropsy is probably due to
diminished absorption, and renal dropsy, when unassociated
with heart failure, to increased exudation. But the starting
point of acute renal dropsy, of the dropsy sometimes occurring
in diabetes, and that of chlorosis is the toxic condition of the
blood. For accounts of the various local dropsies see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hydrocephalus</a></span>;
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ascites</a></span>; <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Liver</a></span>, &amp;c.; general dropsy, or dropsy
which depends on causes acting on the system at large, is due
chiefly to diseases of the heart, kidneys or lungs, occasionally
on lardaceous disease, more rarely still on diabetes or one of the
anaemias.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, 50% of cases of general dropsy are due to
disease of the heart or aorta, and 25% to renal troubles. The
natural tendency of all diseases of the heart is to transfer the
blood pressure from the arteries to the veins, and, so soon as this
has reached a sufficient degree, dropsy in the form of local
<i>oedema</i> commences to appear at whatever may be the most
depending part of the body&mdash;the instep and ankle in the upright
position, the lower part of the back or the lungs if the patient
be in bed&mdash;and this tends gradually to increase till all the cavities
of the body are invaded by the serous accumulation. The
diseases of the lungs which produce dropsy are those which
obstruct the passage of the blood through them, such as emphysema
and fibrosis, and thus act precisely like disease of the
heart in transferring the blood pressure from the arteries to the
veins, inducing dropsy in exactly a similar manner. The dropsy
of renal disease is dependent for the most part on an excess of
exudation, due largely to an increase of arterial and cardiac
tension. This in its turn produces arterial thickening and
cardiac hypertrophy, which, if the case be sufficiently prolonged,
brings about a natural removal of the fluid. In kidney cases,
in the absence of cardiac disease, the dropsy will be found to
appear first about the loose cellular tissue surrounding the eyes,
where the vessels, turgid with watery blood, have less efficient
support. The dropsy of chlorosis is very similar to renal dropsy,
a toxic condition of blood being present in both; also other
forms of anaemia, as also hydraemia, tend to produce or assist
in the production of dropsical effusions.</p>

<p>For the treatment of dropsy the reader is referred to the
articles on the several diseases of which it is a symptom. Briefly,
however, tapping of the abdomen or puncture of the legs are
constantly resorted to in severe cases. Dehydration by diet
is very valuable under certain circumstances when the dropsy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page591" id="page591"></a>591</span>
is other than renal. And there is the routine treatment by
drugs, purgative, diaphoretic and diuretic as the symptoms of
the case may demand.</p>

<p>It may be well to mention that there are certain affections
which may be termed <i>spurious dropsies</i>, such as <i>ovarian dropsy</i>,
which is only a cystic disease of the ovary; <i>hydrometria</i>, dropsy
of the uterus, due to inflammatory occlusion of the os uteri;
<i>hydronephrosis</i>, dropsy of the kidney, due to obstruction of the
ureter, and subsequent distension of these organs by serous
accumulations; other hollow organs may also be similarly
affected.</p>

<p>Having no known relation to the preceding is <i>epidemic dropsy</i>,
the first recorded outbreak of which occurred in Calcutta in the
year 1877. It disappeared during the hot weather of the following
year, only to recur over a wider area in the cold months of 1878
to 1879, and once again in the cold of 1879 to 1880. Since then
only isolated cases have been recorded in the immediate neighbourhood
of Calcutta, though epidemics have broken out in
other places both by land and sea. At the end of 1902 an
outbreak occurred in the Barisal gaol, Bengal, in which nearly
one-third of the cases ended fatally. Dropsy was an invariable
feature of the disease, and was either the first symptom or
occurred early. The lower limbs were first affected, trunk and
upper limbs later in severe cases, the face very rarely. It was
accompanied by pyrexia, gastro-enteritis, deep-seated pains in
limbs and body, and burning and pricking of the skin. Various
rashes appeared early in the attack, while eczema, desquamation
and even ulceration supervened later. Anaemia was very marked,
giving rise in Mauritius to the name of acute anaemic dropsy.
The duration of the disease was very variable, the limits being
three weeks and three months. Death was often sudden,
resulting chiefly from cardiac and respiratory complications.
The cause of the disease has remained obscure, but there is
reason to suppose that it was originally imported from the
Madras famine tracts.</p>

(1797-1848), German poet, was born at the family seat of
Hülshoff near Münster in Westphalia on the 10th of January
1797. Her early mental training was largely influenced by her
cousin, Clemens August, Freiherr von Droste zu Vischering,
who, as archbishop of Cologne, became notorious for his extreme
ultramontane views (see below); and she received a more
liberal education than in those days ordinarily fell to a woman&rsquo;s
lot. After prolonged visits among the intellectual circles at
Coblenz, Bonn and Cologne, she retired to the estate of Ruschhaus
near Münster, belonging to her mother&rsquo;s family. In 1841,
owing to delicate health, she went to reside in the house of her
brother-in-law, the well-known scholar, Joseph, Freiherr von
Lassberg (1770-1855), at Schloss Meersburg on the Lake of
Constance, where she met Levin Schücking (<i>q.v.</i>); and there
she died on the 24th of May 1848. Annette von Droste-Hülshoff

poets. Her verse is strong and vigorous, but often unmusical
even to harshness; one looks in vain for a touch of sentimentality
or melting sweetness in it. As a lyric poet, she is at her best
when she is able to attune her thoughts to the sober landscape
of the Westphalian moorlands of her home. Her narrative
poetry, and especially <i>Das Hospiz auf dem Grossen St Bernard</i>
and <i>Die Schlacht im Loener Bruch</i> (both 1838), belongs to the
best German poetry of its kind. She was a strict Roman Catholic,
and her religious poems, published in 1852, after her death,
under the title <i>Das geistliche Jahr, nebst einem Anhang religiöser
Gedichte</i>, enjoyed great popularity.</p>

(1773-1845), German Roman Catholic divine, was born at
Münster on the 21st of January 1773. He was educated in his
native town and entered the priesthood in 1798; in 1807 the
local chapter elected him vicar-general. This office he resigned
in 1813 through his opposition to Napoleon, but assumed it
again after the battle of Waterloo (1815) until a disagreement
with the Prussian government in 1820 led to his abdication.
He remained in private life until 1835, when he was appointed
archbishop of Cologne. Here again his zeal for the supremacy
of the church led him to break the agreement between the state
and the Catholic bishops which he had signed at his installation,
and he was arrested by the Prussian government in November
1837. A battle of pamphlets raged for some time; Droste was
not re-installed but was obliged to accept a coadjutor. His
chief works were: <i>Über die Religionsfreiheit der Katholiken</i>

<p><span class="bold">DROUAIS, JEAN GERMAIN<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> (1763-1788), French historical
painter, was born at Paris on the 25th of November 1763. His
father, François Hubert Drouais, and his grandfather, Hubert
Drouais, were well-known portrait painters; and it was from his
father that he received his first artistic instruction. He was afterwards
entrusted to the care of Brenet, an excellent teacher, though
his own pictures did not take high rank. In 1780 David, who had
just returned from Rome, opened a school of painting in Paris,
and Drouais was one of his earliest and most promising pupils.
He adopted the classical style of his master, and gave his whole
time to study&mdash;painting during the day, and spending a great
part of every night in designing. For weeks together it is said
that he never left his studio. In 1783 he was admitted to compete
for the great prize of painting offered by the Academy, the
subject being the &ldquo;Widow of Nain.&rdquo; After inspecting the works
of his fellow-competitors, however, he lost hope and destroyed
his own canvas, but was consoled by the assurance of his master
David that had he not done so he would have won the prize.
Next year he was triumphantly successful, the &ldquo;Woman of
Canaan at the Feet of Christ,&rdquo; with which he gained the prize,
being compared by competent critics with the works of Poussin.
He was carried shoulder high by his fellow-students through the
streets to his mother&rsquo;s house, and a place was afterwards found
for his picture in the Louvre. His success making him only
the more eager to perfect himself in his art, he accompanied
David to Rome, where he worked even more assiduously than in
Paris. He was most strongly influenced by the remains of ancient
art and by the works of Raphael. Goethe, who was at Rome
at the time it was finished, has recorded the deep impression
made by his &ldquo;Marius at Minturno,&rdquo; which he characterizes as
in some respects superior to the work of David, his master. The
last picture which he completed was his &ldquo;Philoctetus on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page592" id="page592"></a>592</span>
Island of Lemnos.&rdquo; He died on the 15th of July 1788. A
monument to his memory was erected by his fellow-students
in the church of Santa Maria in the Via Lata.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DROUET, JEAN BAPTISTE<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> (1763-1824), French Revolutionist,
chiefly noted for the part he played in the arrest of
Louis XVI. at Varennes, was born at Sainte-Menehould. He
served for seven years in the army, and afterwards assisted his
father, who was post-master of his native town. The carriages
conveying the royal family on their flight to the frontier stopped
at his door on the evening of the 21st of June 1791; and the
passengers, travelling under assumed names, were recognized
by Drouet, who immediately took steps which led to their arrest
and detection on reaching Varennes. For this service the
Assembly awarded him 30,000 francs, but he appears to have
declined the reward. In September 1792 he was elected deputy
to the Convention, and took his place with the most violent
party. He voted the death of the king without appeal, showed
implacable hostility to the Girondins, and proposed the slaughter
of all English residents in France. Sent as commissioner to the
army of the north, he was captured at the siege of Maubeuge
and imprisoned at Spielberg till the close of 1795. He then
became a member of the Council of Five Hundred, and was
named secretary. Drouet was implicated in the conspiracy of
Babeuf, and was imprisoned; but he made his escape into
Switzerland, and thence to Teneriffe. There he took part in
the successful resistance to the attempt of Nelson on the island,
in 1797, and later visited India. The first empire found in him
a docile sub-prefect of Sainte-Menehould. After the second
Restoration he was compelled to quit France. Returning
secretly he settled at Macon, under the name of Merger and a
guise of piety, and preserved his incognito till his death on the
11th of April 1824.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DROWNING AND LIFE SAVING.<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> To &ldquo;drown&rdquo; (a verb used
both transitively and intransitively, of which the origin, though
traced to earlier forms, is unknown) is to suffer or inflict death
by submersion in water, or figuratively to submerge entirely
in water or some other liquid. As a form of ancient capital
punishment, the method of drowning is referred to at the end
of this article, but the interest of the subject is mainly associated
with rescue-work in cases of accident.</p>

<p>Death from drowning is the result of asphyxia, due to the
stoppage of a supply of fresh air to the lungs. There is a certain
amount of stationary air in the lungs, and into this is diffused
oxygen from the fresh air taken in, while the carbonic acid which
it has taken from the blood through the walls of the capillaries
is driven out. This process of exchange is ever proceeding, the
whole of it being regulated from the nervous centre at the base
of the brain. When a person gets under water and cannot swim,
there is a natural tendency to struggle, and in the efforts to
respire water is drawn into the windpipe and cough is brought
on. This expels the air from the lungs with the water which
threatened to suffocate him, and as further efforts are made to
respire more water is taken in and has to be swallowed. Meanwhile,
the oxygen in the lungs is gradually diminishing, the
quantity of carbonic acid is increasing, and at length the air in
the lungs becomes too impure to effect an exchange with the
blood. Then the blood passing into the heart becomes venous
and the heart begins to send out venous instead of arterial
blood to all parts of the body. Immediately a dull, sickening
pain becomes apparent at the base of the neck, and insensibility
rapidly ensues. This arises from the affection of the respiratory
nerve centre. In a short space of time the face becomes dark
and congested through the veins being gorged with blood, and
the heart ultimately ceases to beat.</p>

<tr><td class="caption1"><span class="sc">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;1st Release Method.</td></tr></table>

<p>When a person unable to swim falls into the water, he usually
rises to the surface, throws up his arms and calls for help. This,
with the water swallowed, will make him sink, and if the arms
are moved above the head when under water, he will, as a natural
consequence, sink still lower. The struggle will be prolonged a
few seconds, and then probably cease for a time, allowing him
to rise again, though perhaps not sufficiently high to enable him
to get another breath of air. If still conscious, he will renew his
struggle, more feebly perhaps, but with the same result. As
soon as insensibility occurs, the body sinks altogether, owing
to the loss of air and the filling of the stomach with water. There
is a general belief that a drowning person must rise three times
before he finally sinks,
but this is a fallacy.
The question whether
he rises at all, or how
often he does so, entirely
depends upon
circumstances. A man
may get entangled
among weeds, which
prevent his coming
to the surface, or he
may die through heart
failure from the shock
or fright of entering
the water.</p>

<p>On seeing a person
struggling in the
water in danger of drowning, no time should be lost in going
to his assistance, for he may sink at once, and then there is
danger of missing the body when searching under water for
it, or it may get entangled among weeds and then the rescuer&rsquo;s
task is rendered doubly dangerous. Before diving in to the
rescue the boots and heavy clothing should be discarded
if possible, and in cases where a leap has to be made from
a height, such as a bridge, high embankment, vessel or
pier, or where the depth of the water is not known, it is best
to drop in feet first. Where weeds abound there is always
danger of entanglement, and therefore progress should be made
in the direction of the stream. When approaching a drowning
man there is always the danger of being clutched, but a swimmer
who knows the right way to deal with a man in the water can
easily avoid this; but if through some mistake he finds himself
seized by the drowning person, a necessary thing for the swimmer
to do is to take advantage of his knowledge of the water and
keep uppermost, as this weakens the drowning person and makes
the effort of effecting a release much easier than would otherwise
be the case. To the Royal Life Saving Society in England is
due the credit of disseminating, throughout the entire world,
the ideas of swimmers, based on practical experience, as to the
safest methods which should be adopted for release and rescue,
and their methods, as well as the approved ones for resuscitation,
are now taught in almost every school and college.</p>

<p>If the rescuer be held by the wrists, he must turn both arms
simultaneously against the drowning person&rsquo;s thumbs, and
bring his arms at right angles to the body, thus dislocating the
thumbs of the drowning person if he does not leave go (fig. 1).
If he be clutched
round the neck he
must take a deep
breath and lean well
over the drowning
person, at the same
time placing one hand
in the small of his
back, then raise the
other arm in line with
the shoulder, and
pass it over the
drowning person&rsquo;s
arm, then pinch the
nostrils close with
the fingers, and at
the same time place the palm of the hand on the chin and push
away with all possible force. By the firm holding of the nose the
drowning person is made to open his mouth for breathing, and
as he will then be under water, choking ensues and he gives way
to the rescuer, who then gains complete control (fig. 2). One of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page593" id="page593"></a>593</span>
the most dangerous clutches is that round the body and arms
or round the body only. When so tackled the rescuer should
lean well over the drowning person, take a breath as before, and
either withdraw both arms in an upward direction in front of
his body, or else act in the same way as when releasing oneself
when clutched round
the neck. In any case
one hand must be placed
on the drowning man&rsquo;s
shoulder, and the palm
of the other hand
against his chin, and at
the same time one knee
should be brought up
against the lower part
of his chest. Then,
with a strong and sudden
push, the arms and
legs should be stretched
out straight and the
whole weight of the
body thrown backwards.
This sudden and totally
unexpected action will
break the clutch and leave the rescuer free to get hold of the
drowning person in such a manner as to be able to bring him to
land (fig. 3).</p>

<p>There are several practical methods of carrying a person
through the water, the easiest assistance to render being that
to a swimmer attacked by cramp or exhaustion, or a drowning
person who may be obedient and remain quiet when approached
and assured of safety. Then the person assisted should place
his arms on the rescuer&rsquo;s shoulders, close to the neck, with the
arms at full stretch, lie on his back perfectly still, with the
head well back. The
rescuer will then be
uppermost, and having
his arms and legs
free can, with the
breast stroke, make
rapid progress to the
shore; indeed a good
pace can easily be
made (fig. 4). In</p>

<p>this, as in the other methods afterwards described, every care
should be taken to keep the face of the drowning person above
the water. All jerking, struggling or tugging should be avoided,
and the stroke of the legs be regular and well timed, thus husbanding
strength for further effort. The drowning person being
able to breathe with freedom is reassured, and is likely to cease
struggling, feeling that he is in safe hands.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;1st Rescue Method.</td></tr></table>

<p>When a drowning person is not struggling, but yet seems
likely to do so when approached, the best method of rescue is
to swim straight up, turn him on his back, and then place the
hands on either side of his face. Then the rescuer should lie
on his back, holding the drowning man in front of him, and swim
with the back stroke, always taking care to keep the man&rsquo;s face
above water (fig. 5). If the man be struggling and in a condition
difficult to manage, he should be turned on his back as before,
and a firm hold taken of his arms just above his elbows. Then
the man&rsquo;s arms should be drawn up at right angles to his body
and the rescuer should start swimming with the back stroke
(fig. 6). He should take particular care not to go against the
current or stream, and thereby avoid exhaustion. If the arms
be difficult to grasp, or the struggling so violent as to prevent a
firm hold, the rescuer should slip his hands under the armpits
of the drowning person,
and place them
on his chest or round
his arms, then raise
them at right angles
to his body, thus placing
the drowning person
completely in his
power. The journey
to land can then be
made by swimming
on the back as in the
other methods (fig. 7). In carrying a person through the water, it
will be of much advantage to keep his elbows well out from the
sides, as this expands the chest, inflates the lungs and adds to his
buoyancy. The legs should be kept well up to the surface and
the whole body as horizontal as possible. This avoids a drag
through the water, and will considerably help the rescuer. In
some cases it may happen that the drowning person has sunk to
the bottom and does not rise again. In that event the rescuer
should look for bubbles rising to the surface before diving in.
In still water the bubbles rise perpendicularly; in running water
they rise obliquely, so that the rescuer must look for his object
higher up the stream than where the bubbles rise. It is also
well to remember that in running water a body may be carried
along by the current and must be looked for in the direction in
which it flows. When a drowning person is recovered on the
bottom, the rescuer should seize him by the head or shoulders,
place the left foot on the ground and the right knee in the small
of his back, and then, with a vigorous push, come to the surface.</p>

<p>When the rescuer reaches land with an insensible person, no
time should be lost in sending for a medical man, but in the
meantime an attempt to induce artificial respiration may be
made. The first recorded cases of resuscitating the apparently
drowned are mentioned in the notes to William Derham&rsquo;s
<i>Physico-Theology</i>, as having occurred at Troningholm and Oxford,
about 1650. In 1745 Dr J. Fothergill read a paper on the subject
before the Royal Society. It dealt with the recovery of a man
dead in appearance by distending the lungs by Mr William
Tossack, surgeon in Alloa, in 1744. In 1767 several cases of
resuscitation were reported in Switzerland, and shortly after a
society was formed at Amsterdam for recovery of the apparently
drowned, and to instruct the common people as to the best
manner of treating them when rescued, and to reward the people
for their services. In 1773 Dr A. Johnson suggested the formation
of a similar society in England, and Dr Thomas Cogan
translated the memoirs
of the Amsterdam
society. Dr William
Hawes secured a copy
and tried to form a
society. There was,
however, a strong prejudice
against the idea,
but he publicly offered
rewards to persons who,
between Westminster
and London Bridges,
should rescue drowning
persons and bring them
to certain places on shore in order that resuscitation might be
attempted. In this way he was instrumental in the saving of
several lives, and paid the rewards out of his own pocket, until
his zeal brought him sympathy and the Royal Humane Society
was founded. This was in 1774. The system then in vogue was
a means of inducing artificial respiration by inserting the pipe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page594" id="page594"></a>594</span>
of a pair of bellows into one nostril and closing the other. Air
was forced into the lungs and then expelled by pressing the chest,
thus imitating respiration. Dr Hawes used for his resuscitation
work a kind of cradle, in which the subject was placed, and then
raised over a furnace. Bleeding, holding up by the heels, rolling
on casks, &amp;c. were at various times resorted to. Simple means
are often as effective as the official ones. In 1891 a subject was
restored in Australia by being held over a smoky fire, which is
the native method of restoring life; while a few years back,
at an English riverside town, a patient was saved by the placing
of a handkerchief over his mouth and the alternate blowing into
and drawing air out of the lungs until natural breathing was
restored.</p>

<p>One of the oldest methods of resuscitation was that of Dr
Marshall Hall (1790-1857), introduced in 1856. In this method
the operator takes his place at the patient&rsquo;s left side, and places
a roll of clothing or pillow (which must be the same length as
that used in the previous methods), so that it may be in position
under the chest when the patient is turned over. The assistant
at the head pays particular attention to the patient&rsquo;s arms,
that they may not be laid upon or twisted at the wrists, elbows,
hands or shoulders. The patient is then turned face downwards,
with the body reclining over the pillow, the operator makes a
firm pressure with the hand upon the back, between and on the
shoulder blades, he then pulls the patient slowly up on to the side
towards himself. Once in position, the operator pushes the
patient back again until the face is downward, when the pressure
on the back is to be repeated. These three movements must be
continued at the rate of about fifteen times a minute, until
natural breathing has been restored.</p>

<p>Then came the methods of Dr H. R. Silvester and Dr Benjamin
Howard, of New York.</p>

<p>When using the Silvester method, or, for the matter of that,
any other method, the first thing to do is to send for medical
assistance. Dr Silvester recommended that the patient should
not be carried face downwards or held up by his feet. All rough
usage should be avoided, especially twisting or bending of limbs,
and the patient must not be allowed to remain on the back unless
the tongue is pulled forward. In the event of respiration not
being entirely suspended when a person is lifted out of the water,
it may not be necessary to imitate breathing, but natural respiration
may be assisted by the application of an irritant substance
to the nostrils and tickling the nose. Smelling-salts, pepper and
snuff may be used, or hot and cold water alternately dashed on
the face or chest. Provided no sign of life can be seen or felt or
the heart&rsquo;s action heard, promotion of breathing, <i>not</i> circulation
must be the first aim and effort. Lay the patient flat on his back,
with the head at a slightly higher level than the feet. Remove
all tight clothing about the neck, chest and abdomen, and loosen
the braces, belts or corsets. The operator taking his place at
the head, with an assistant on one side, will turn the patient over
until he is lying face downwards, his head resting upon one arm.
He should then, after the assistant has given one or two sharp
blows with the open hand between the shoulder blades, wipe and
clear the mouth, throat and nostrils of all matter that may
prevent the air from entering the lungs, using a handkerchief
for this purpose. This being done, the patient should be turned
upon his back, the tongue pulled forward and kept in position
by means of a dry cloth, handkerchief or piece of string tied
round the jaw. Every care must be taken not to let it fall back
into the mouth and thus obstruct the air passages. When this
work has been accomplished (it should only last a few seconds)
the operator at the head should lift the patient, handling the
head and shoulders very carefully, in order that the assistant
may place a roll of clothing or pillow under the shoulder blades.
The roll being placed in position, the operator will lean forward
and grasp the arms below the elbows. He will then draw the
patient&rsquo;s arms steadily upwards and outwards, above the head,
until fully extended in line with the body. Having held the arms
in this position for about one second, the operator will carry them
back again and press them firmly against the side and front of
the chest for another second. By these means an exchange of
air is produced in the lungs similar to that effected by natural
respiration. These movements must be repeated carefully and
deliberately about fifteen times a minute, and persevered in.
When natural respiration is once established, the operator should
cease to imitate the movements of breathing, and proceed with
the treatment for <i>the promotion of warmth and circulation</i>.</p>

<p>Friction over the surface of the body must be at once resorted
to, using handkerchiefs, flannels, &amp;c., so as to propel the blood
along the veins towards the heart, while the operator attends
to the mouth, nose and throat. The friction along the legs,
arms and body should all be towards the heart and should be
continued after the patient has been wrapped in blankets or
some dry clothing. As soon as possible, the patient should be
removed to the nearest house and further efforts made to promote
warmth by the application of hot flannels to the pit of the
stomach, and bottles or bladders of hot water, heated bricks, &amp;c.
to the armpits, between the thighs and to the soles of the feet.
If there be pain or difficulty in breathing, apply a hot linseed
meal poultice to the chest. On the restoration of life, a teaspoonful
of warm water should be given; and then, if the power of
swallowing has returned, very small quantities of wine, warm
brandy and water, beef tea or coffee administered, the patient
kept in bed, and a disposition to sleep encouraged. The patient
should be carefully watched for some time to see that breathing
does not fail, and, should any signs of failure appear, artificial
respiration should at once be resumed. While the patient is
in the house, care should be taken to let the air circulate freely
about the room and all overcrowding should be prevented.</p>

<p>In the Howard method there are only two movements; its
knowledge is said to be necessary in case the patient&rsquo;s arm
be in any way injured, or a more vigorous method than the
&ldquo;Silvester&rdquo; deemed necessary, <i>but care should be exercised not to
injure the patient by too forcible pressure</i>. The patient is laid on
his back, the roll is larger than that used in the Silvester method,
and is placed farther under the back in order that the lower part
of the chest may be highest. After adjusting the roll, the operator
kneels astride of the patient, while his assistant goes to the
head, lifts the patient&rsquo;s arms beyond the head, and holds them
to the ground, cleans the mouth and nose, and attends to the
tongue. The operator, with his fingers spread well apart, taking
care that the thumbs do not press into the pit of the stomach,
grasps the most compressible part of the lower ribs, and with
both hands applies pressure firmly by leaning over the patient;
then he springs back, lifting his hands off the patient. Artificial
respiration is thus effected, and continued at the rate of about
fifteen times a minute. When natural breathing has been
restored, the treatment is the same as in the Silvester method.</p>

<p>These methods have now been superseded by the Schäfer
method, which has been taken up by the Royal Life Saving
Society, a body instituted in 1891 for the promotion of technical
education in life saving and resuscitation of the apparently
drowned. The Schäfer method has much to recommend it,
owing to its extreme simplicity and the ease with which the
physical operations necessary to carry on artificial respiration
may be performed, hardly any muscular exertion being required.
It involves no risk of injury to the congested liver or to any
other organ, and as the patient is laid face downwards, there is
no possibility of the air passages being blocked by the falling
back of the tongue into the pharynx. The water and mucus can
also be expelled much more readily from the air passages through
the mouth and nostrils.</p>

<p>It was due to the happy selection of Professor E. A. Schäfer,
as chairman of a committee appointed by the Royal Medical &amp;
Chirurgical Society for the investigation of the methods in use
for resuscitation of the apparently drowned, that the new
method was devised. This committee made many experiments
upon the cadaver but failed to arrive at any definite conclusion
by that means. The necessity then appeared of thorough
investigation of the subject by experiments upon animals, so
that the phenomena attendant upon drowning might be better
known, and the various methods of resuscitation properly tried.
These experiments were made in Edinburgh by Professor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page595" id="page595"></a>595</span>
Schäfer, with the co-operation of Dr P. T. Herring, and the
results obtained were embodied in the report of the committee,
which was presented to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society
in 1904, and published as a supplement to volume 86 of the
<i>Transactions</i> of the society. As the direct outcome of these
experiments, Professor Schäfer was led to believe that a pressure
method of resuscitation was not only simpler to perform but
also more efficacious than any other. This conclusion was put
to the test by measurements of the results obtained upon the
normal human subject by the various methods in vogue; from
these measurements, which were published in the <i>Proceedings</i>
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in December 1903, it appeared
that when such pressure is exerted in the prone
position the highest degree of efficiency as well as
simplicity is obtained. The description of this method
was communicated to the Royal Medical and Chirurgical
Society, and was published in the following year
(1904) in volume 87 of the <i>Transactions</i> of the
society.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that by investigating the
phenomena of drowning, and the means of resuscitation
in dogs, and by applying the results obtained to
man, the method which the society now advocates
as the best was arrived at. In the experiments
referred to, it was found necessary to drown 38
dogs, all but two of which were from first to last in
a complete state of anaesthesia, the two exceptions having
been simply drowned without anaesthesia. It is important
that the public should understand that the evolution of a
method which will probably be the means of saving thousands
of lives has resulted from the painless sacrifice of less
than 40 dogs, a number which would doubtless in any case
have been destroyed by drowning or some other form of suffocation,
but without the benefit of the anaesthetics which were
employed in the experiments.</p>

<p>Professor Schäfer describes the method as follows:&mdash;Lay the
subject face downwards on the ground, then without stopping
to remove the clothing the operator should at once place himself
in position astride or at one side of the subject, facing his head
and kneeling upon one or both knees. He then places his
hands flat over the lower part of the back (on the lowest ribs),
one on each side (fig. 8), and then gradually throws the weight
of his body forward on to them so as to produce firm pressure
(fig. 9)&mdash;which must not be violent, or upon the patient&rsquo;s chest.
By this means the air, and water if any, are driven out of the
patient&rsquo;s lungs. Immediately thereafter the operator raises
his body slowly so as to remove the pressure, but the hands are
left in position. This forward and backward movement is
repeated every four or five seconds; in other words, the body
of the operator is swayed slowly forwards and backwards upon
the arms from twelve to fifteen times a minute, and should be
continued for at least half an hour, or until the natural respirations
are resumed. Whilst one person is carrying out artificial
respiration in this way, others may, if there be opportunity,
busy themselves with applying hot flannels to the body and
limbs, and hot bottles to the feet, but no attempt should be
made to remove the wet clothing or to give any restoratives by
the mouth until natural breathing has recommenced.</p>

<p>In his paper read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in
December 1903 Professor Schäfer gave the following table of the
relative exchanges of air under different methods:&mdash;</p>

<p>These experiments all tend to show that by far the most
efficient method of performing artificial respiration is that of
intermittent pressure upon the lower ribs with the subject in the
prone position or face downward. It is also the easiest to perform,
requiring practically no exertion, as the weight of the operator&rsquo;s
body produces the effect, and the swinging forwards and backwards
of the body some thirteen times a minute, which alone
is required, is by no means fatiguing, and has the further great
advantage that it can be effectively carried out by one person.</p>

<p><i>Penal Use of Drowning.</i>&mdash;As a form of capital punishment,
drowning was once common throughout Europe, but it is now
only practised in Mahommedan countries and the Far East.
Tacitus states that the ancient Germans hanged criminals of
any rank, but those of the low classes were drowned beneath
hurdles in fens and bogs. The Romans also drowned convicts.
The Lex Cornelia ordained that parricides should be sewn in a
sack with a dog, cock, viper and ape, and thrown into the sea.
The law of ancient Burgundy ordered that an unfaithful wife
should be smothered in mud. The Anglo-Saxon punishment
for women guilty of theft was drowning. So usual was the
penalty in the middle ages that grants of life and death jurisdiction
were worded to be &ldquo;<i>cum fossa et furca</i>&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;with
drowning-pit and gallows&rdquo;). The owner of Baynard&rsquo;s Castle,
London, in the reign of John, had powers of trying criminals,
and his descendants long afterwards claimed the privileges,
the most valued of which was the right of drowning in the Thames
traitors taken within their jurisdiction. Drowning was the punishment
ordained by Richard C&oelig;ur de Lion for any soldier of his
army who killed a fellow-crusader during the passage to the
Holy Land. Drowning was usually reserved for women as being
the least brutal form of death-penalty, but occasionally a male
criminal was so executed as a matter of favour. Thus in Scotland
in 1526 a man convicted of theft and sacrilege was ordered to
be drowned &ldquo;by the queen&rsquo;s special grace.&rdquo; In 1611 a man
was drowned at Edinburgh for stealing a lamb, and in 1623
eleven gipsy women suffered there. By that date the penalty
was obsolete in England. It survived in Scotland till 1685
(the year of the drowning of the Wigtoun martyrs). The last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page596" id="page596"></a>596</span>
execution by drowning in Switzerland was in 1652, in Austria
1776, in Iceland 1777; while in France during the Revolution
the penalty was revived in the terrible <i>Noyades</i> carried out by the
terrorist Jean Baptiste Carrier at Nantes. It was abolished in
Russia at the beginning of the 18th century.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DROYSEN, JOHANN GUSTAV<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> (1808-1884), German historian,
was born on the 6th of July 1808 at Treptow in Pomerania.
His father, Johann Christoph Droysen, was an army chaplain, in
which capacity he was present at the celebrated siege of Kolberg
in 1806-7. As a child young Droysen witnessed some of the
military operations during the War of Liberation, for his father
was pastor at Greifenhagen, in the immediate neighbourhood of
Stettin, which was held by the French during the greater part of
1813. The impressions of these early years laid the foundation
of the ardent attachment to Prussia which distinguished him,
like so many other historians of his generation. He was educated
at the gymnasium of Stettin and at the university of Berlin;
in 1829 he became a master at the Graue Kloster (or Grey Friars),
one of the oldest schools in Berlin; besides his work there he
gave lectures at the university, from 1833 as <i>privat-dozent</i>, and
from 1835 as professor, without a salary. During these years
he was occupied with classical antiquity; he published a translation
of Aeschylus and a paraphrase of Aristophanes, but the
work by which he made himself known as a historian was his
<i>Geschichte Alexanders des Grossen</i> (Berlin, 1833, and other
editions), a book which still remains probably the best work
on the subject. It was in some ways the herald of a new school
of German historical thought, for it shows that idealization of
power and success which he had learnt from the teaching of Hegel.
It was followed by other volumes dealing with the successors
of Alexander, published under the title of <i>Geschichte des Hellenismus</i>
(Hamburg, 1836-1843). A new and revised edition of the
whole work was published in 1885; it has been translated into
French, but not into English.</p>

<p>In 1840 Droysen was appointed professor of history at Kiel.
He was at once attracted into the political movement for the
defence of the rights of the Elbe duchies, of which Kiel was
the centre. Like his predecessor F. C. Dahlmann, he placed
his historical learning at the service of the estates of Schleswig-Holstein
and composed the address of 1844, in which the estates
protested against the claim of the king of Denmark to alter
the law of succession in the duchies. In 1848 he was elected
a member of the Frankfort parliament, and acted as secretary
to the committee for drawing up the constitution. He was a
determined supporter of Prussian ascendancy, and was one of
the first members to retire after the king of Prussia refused
the imperial crown in 1849. During the next two years he continued
to support the cause of the duchies, and in 1850, with
Carl Samwer, he published a history of the dealings of Denmark
with Schleswig-Holstein, <i>Die Herzogthümer Schleswig-Holstein
und das Königreich Dänemark seit dem Jahre 1806</i> (Hamburg,
1850). A translation was published in London in the same
year under the title <i>The Policy of Denmark towards the Duchies
of Schleswig-Holstein</i>. The work was one of great political
importance, and had much to do with the formation of German
public opinion on the rights of the duchies in their struggle with
Denmark.</p>

<p>After 1851 it was impossible for him to remain at Kiel, and he
was appointed to a professorship at Jena; in 1859 he was called
to Berlin, where he remained till his death. In his later years he
was almost entirely occupied with Prussian history. In 1851
he brought out a life of Count Yorck von Wartenburg (Berlin,
1851-1852, and many later editions), one of the best biographies
in the German language, and then began his great work on the
<i>Geschichte der preussischen Politik</i> (Berlin, 1855-1886). Seven
volumes were published, the last not till after his death. It
forms a complete history of the growth of the Prussian monarchy
down to the year 1756. This, like all Droysen&rsquo;s work, shows a
strongly marked individuality, and a great power of tracing the
manner in which important dynamic forces worked themselves
out in history. It was this characteristic quality of comprehensiveness
that also gave him so much influence as a teacher.</p>

<p>Droysen, who was twice married, died in Berlin on the 19th
of June 1884. His eldest son, Gustav, is the author of several
well-known historical works, namely, <i>Gustav Adolf</i> (Leipzig,
1869-1870); <i>Herzog Bernhard von Weimar</i> (Leipzig, 1885);
an admirable <i>Historischer Handatlas</i> (Leipzig, 1885), and several
writings on various events of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War. Another
son, Hans Droysen, is the author of some works on Greek history
and antiquities.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DROZ, ANTOINE GUSTAVE<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> (1832-1895), French man of
letters, son of the sculptor J. A. Droz (1807-1872), was born in
Paris on the 9th of June 1832. He was educated as an artist,
and began to exhibit in the Salon of 1857. A series of sketches
dealing gaily and lightly with the intimacies of family life,
published in the <i>Vie parisienne</i> and issued in book form as
<i>Monsieur, Madame et Bébé</i> (1866), won for the author an immediate
and great success. <i>Entre nous</i> (1867) was built on a
similar plan, and was followed by some psychological novels:
<i>Le Cahier bleu de Mlle Cibot</i> (1868); <i>Autour d&rsquo;une source</i> (1869);
<i>Un Paquet de lettres</i> (1870); <i>Babolein</i> (1872); <i>Les Étangs</i> (1875);
<i>L&rsquo;Enfant</i> (1885). His <i>Tristesses et sourires</i> (1884) is a delicate
analysis of the niceties of family intercourse and its difficulties.
Droz&rsquo;s first book was translated into English under the title of
<i>Papa, Mamma and Baby</i> (1887). <i>Un Été à la campagne</i>, a book
which caused considerable scandal, was erroneously attributed
to him. He died on the 22nd of October 1895.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DROZ, FRANÇOIS-XAVIER JOSEPH<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (1773-1850), French
writer on ethics and political science, was born on the 31st of
October 1773 at Besançon, where his family had furnished
men of considerable mark to the legal profession. His own legal
studies led him to Paris in 1792; he arrived on the very day
after the dethronement of the king, and was present during the
massacres of September; on the declaration of war he joined
the volunteer <i>bataillon</i> of the Doubs, and for the next three years
served in the Army of the Rhine. Receiving his discharge on
the score of ill-health, he obtained a much more congenial post
in the newly-founded <i>école centrale</i> of Besançon; and in 1799
he made his first appearance as an author by an <i>Essai sur l&rsquo;art
oratoire</i> (Paris, Fructidor, An VII.), in which he acknowledges
his indebtedness more especially to Hugh Blair. Removing to
Paris in 1803, he became intimate not only with the like-minded
Ducis, but also with the sceptical Cabanis; and it was on this
philosopher&rsquo;s advice that, in order to catch the public ear, he
produced the romance of <i>Lina</i>, which Sainte-Beuve has characterized
as a mingled echo of Florian and <i>Werther</i>. Like several
other literary men of the time, he obtained a post in the revenue
office known as the <i>Droits réunis</i>; but from 1814 he devoted
himself exclusively to literature and became a contributor to
various journals. Already favourably known by his <i>Essai sur
l&rsquo;art d&rsquo;être heureux</i> (Paris, 1806), his <i>Éloge de Montaigne</i> (1812), and
his <i>Essai sur le beau dans les arts</i> (1815), he not only gained the
Monthyon prize in 1823 by his work <i>De la philosophie morale ou
des différents systèmes sur la science de la vie</i>, but also in 1824
obtained admission to the Académie Française. The main
doctrine inculcated in this last treatise is that society will never
be in a proper state till men have been educated to think of
their duties and not of their rights. It was followed in 1825 by
<i>Application de la morale à la philosophie et à la politique</i>, and
in 1829 by <i>Économie politique, ou principes de la science
des richesses</i>, a methodical and clearly written treatise, which
was edited by Michel Chevalier in 1854. His next and greatest
work was a <i>Histoire du règne de Louis XVI</i> (3 vols., Paris, 1839-1842).
As he advanced in life Droz became more and more
decidedly religious, and the last work of his prolific pen was
<i>Pensées du Christianisme</i> (1842). Few have left so blameless a
reputation: in the words of Sainte-Beuve, he was born and he
remained all his life of the race of the good and the just.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRUG,<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> a district and town of British India, in the Chhattisgarh
division of the Central Provinces. The district was formed
in 1906 out of portions of the districts of Bilaspur and Raipur.
It has an area of 3807 sq. m., and the population on that area
in 1901 was 628,885, showing a heavy decrease in the preceding
decade, owing to the famines of 1897 and 1900. The district
is a long narrow tract, with lofty ridges of gravel in the centre
and north, but otherwise consisting of open rolling country.
The Tendula and Seonath are the principal rivers. Rich black
soil covers a large part of the district, and rice, wheat and other
crops are grown. The main line of the Bengal-Nagpur railway
passes through the district. Drug, the capital of the district,

<p><span class="bold">DRUG<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (from Fr. <i>drogue</i>, a word common in Romance languages,

may possibly be connected with Dutch <i>droog</i>, dry), any organic
and inorganic substance used in the preparation of medicines,
by itself or in combination with others, and either prepared by
some method or used in a natural state (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pharmacology</a></span>
and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pharmacopoeia</a></span>). In a particular sense &ldquo;drug&rdquo; is often

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRUIDISM,<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> the name usually given to the religious system
of the ancient inhabitants of Gaul and the British Islands. The
word Druid (Lat. <i>druida</i>) probably represents a Gaulish <i>druid-s</i>,
Irish <i>drúi</i>, gen. sing. <i>drúad</i>. On the analogy of Irish <i>súi&lt;su-vid-s</i>
the word has been analysed into <i>dru-vid-</i>, &ldquo;very knowing,
wise.&rdquo; The ancient Welsh form of the word does not exist.
Welsh <i>derwydd</i> and <i>dryw</i> are probably to be regarded as of recent
coinage, as also the Breton forms <i>drouiz</i>, <i>druz</i>. The important
part played by the oak in the religious cults of other countries
suggests a connexion with Greek <span class="grk" title="drus">&#948;&#961;&#8166;&#962;</span>, oak, but this etymology
is rather in disfavour at the present time.</p>

<p>We find in Caesar the first and at the same time the most
circumstantial account of the Druids to be met with in the
classical writers. He tells us that all men of any rank and
dignity in Gaul were included among the Druids or the nobles.
In other words, the Druids constituted the learned and the
priestly class, and they were in addition the chief expounders
and guardians of the law. We are, however, informed by
Diodorus and Strabo that this class was composed of Druids, bards
and soothsayers. Hence Caesar seems to assign more extensive
functions to the Druids than they actually possessed. The
substance of Caesar&rsquo;s account is as follows. On those who
refused to submit to their decisions they had the power of inflicting
severe penalties, of which excommunication from society
was the most dreaded. As they were not a hereditary caste and
enjoyed exemption from service in the field as well as from payment
of taxes, admission to the order was eagerly sought after
by the youth of Gaul. The course of training to which a novice
had to submit was protracted, extending sometimes over twenty
years. All instruction was communicated orally, but for
ordinary purposes they had a written language in which they
used the Greek characters. The president of the order, whose
office was elective and who enjoyed the dignity for life, had
supreme authority among them. They taught that the soul was
immortal. Astrology, geography, physical science and natural
theology were their favourite studies.</p>

<p>Britain was the headquarters of Druidism, but once every
year a general assembly of the order was held within the territories
of the Carnutes in Gaul. The Gauls were accustomed to
offer human sacrifices, usually criminals. Cicero remarks on
the existence among the Gauls of augurs or soothsayers, known
by the name of Druids, with one of whom, Divitiacus, an Aeduan,
he was acquainted. Diodorus informs us that a sacrifice acceptable
to the gods must be attended by a Druid, for they are the
intermediaries. Before a battle they often throw themselves
between two armies to bring about peace. They are said to
have had a firm belief in the immortality of the soul and in
metempsychosis, a fact which led several ancient writers to
conclude that they had been influenced by the teaching of the
Greek philosopher Pythagoras.</p>

<p>A rescript of Augustus forbade Roman citizens to practise
druidical rites. In Strabo we find the Druids still acting as
arbiters in public and private matters, but they no longer deal
with cases of murder. Under Tiberius the Druids were suppressed
by a decree of the senate, but this had to be renewed by
Claudius in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 54. In Mela we find the Druids teaching in the
depths of a forest or in caverns. In Pliny their activity is limited
to the practice of medicine and sorcery. According to this
writer the Druids held the mistletoe in the highest veneration.
Groves of oak were their chosen retreat. Whatever grew on
that tree was thought to be a gift from heaven, more especially
the mistletoe. When thus found, the mistletoe was cut with a
golden knife by a priest clad in a white robe, two white bulls
being sacrificed on the spot. Tacitus, in describing the attack
made on the island of Mona (Anglesea) by the Romans under
Suetonius Paulinus, represents the legionaries as being awe-struck
on landing by the appearance of a band of Druids, who,
with hands uplifted towards heaven, poured forth terrible
imprecations on the heads of the invaders. The courage of the
Romans, however, soon overcame such fears; the Britons were
put to flight; and the groves of Mona, the scene of many a
sacrifice and bloody rite, were cut down.</p>

<p>After this the continental Druids disappear entirely, and are
only referred to on very rare occasions. Ausonius, for instance,
apostrophizes the rhetorician Attius Patera as sprung from a
race of Druids.</p>

<p>When we turn to the British Islands we find, as we should
expect, no traces of the Druids in England and Wales after the
conquest of Anglesea mentioned above, except in the story of
Vortigern as recounted by Nennius. After being excommunicated
by Germanus the British leader invites twelve Druids to
assist him. These probably came from North Britain. In
Irish literature, however, the Druids are frequently mentioned,
and their functions in the island seem to correspond fairly well
to those of their Gaulish brethren described by classical writers.
The functions of Caesar&rsquo;s Druids we here find distributed amongst
Druids, bards and poets (<i>fili</i>), but even in very early times the
poet has usurped many of the duties of the Druid and finally
supplants him with the spread of Christianity. The following
is the position of the Druid in the pagan literature. The most
important documents are contained in MSS. of the 12th century,
but the texts themselves go back in large measure to about
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 700. In the heroic cycles the Druids do not appear to have
formed any corporation, nor do they seem to have been exempt
from military service. Cathbu (Cathbad), the Druid connected
with Conchobar, king of Ulster, in the older cycle is accompanied
by a number of youths (100 according to the oldest version)
who are desirous of learning his art, though what this consisted
in we are not told. The Druids are represented as being able
to foretell the future and to perform magic. Before setting out
on the great expedition against Ulster, Medb, queen of Connaught,
goes to consult her Druid, and just before the famous heroine
Derdriu (Deirdre) is born, Cathbu prophesies what sort of a
woman she will be. We may cite two instances of the magical
skill of the Druids. The hero Cuchulinn has returned from the
land of the fairies after having been enticed thither by a fairy-woman
named Fand, whom he is now unable to forget. He is
given a potion by some Druids, which banishes all memory of his
recent adventures and which also rids his wife Emer of the pangs
of jealousy. More remarkable still is the story of Etain. This
lady, now the wife of Eochaid Airem, high-king of Ireland, was
in a former existence the beloved of the god Mider, who again
seeks her love and carries her off. The king has recourse to his
Druid Dal&#257;n, who requires a whole year to discover the haunt
of the couple. This he accomplished by means of four wands of
yew inscribed with ogam characters. The following description
of the band of Cathbu&rsquo;s Druids occurs in the epic tale, the
<i>Cattle-spoiling of Cualnge</i> (Cooley): &ldquo;The attendant raises his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page598" id="page598"></a>598</span>
eyes towards heaven and observes the clouds and answers the
band around him. They all raise their eyes towards heaven,
observe the clouds, and hurl spells against the elements, so that
they arouse strife amongst them and clouds of fire are driven
towards the camp of the men of Ireland.&rdquo; We are further told
that at the court of Conchobar no one had the right to speak
before the Druids had spoken. In other texts the Druids are
able to produce insanity.</p>

<p>In the religious literature they are almost exclusively represented
as magicians and diviners opposing the Christian missionaries,
though we find two of them acting as tutors to the daughters
of Laegaire, the high-king, at the coming of St Patrick. They
are represented as endeavouring to prevent the progress of St
Patrick and St Columba by raising clouds and mist. Before the
battle of Culdremne (561) a Druid made an <i>airbe drúad</i> (fence
of protection?) round one of the armies, but what is precisely
meant by the phrase is obscure. The Irish Druids seem to have
had a peculiar tonsure. The word <i>drúi</i> is always used to render
the Latin <i>magus</i>, and in one passage St Columba speaks of Christ
as his Druid.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRUM<a name="ar63" id="ar63"></a></span> (early forms <i>drome</i> or <i>dromme</i>, a word common to many
Teut. languages, cf. Dan. <i>tromme</i>, Ger. <i>Trommel</i>: the word is
ultimately the same as &ldquo;trumpet,&rdquo; and is probably onomatopoeic
in origin; it appears late in Eng. about the middle of the 16th
century), the name given to the well-known musical instrument
(see below) and also to many objects resembling it in shape.
Thus it is used of any receptacle of similar shape, as a &ldquo;drum&rdquo;
of oil, &amp;c.; in machinery, of a revolving cylinder, round which
belting is passed; of the <i>tympanum</i> or cylindrically shaped
middle ear, and specially of the membrane that closes the
external auditory meatus; and, in architecture, of the substructure
of a dome when raised to some height above the
pendentives. The architectural drum had a twofold object;
first, to give greater elevation to the dome externally so that it
should rise well above the surrounding building, and secondly,
to allow of the interior being lighted with vertical windows cut
in the drum, instead of forming penetrations in the dome itself,
as in St Sophia, Constantinople. The term is also applied to the
circular blocks of stone, which in columns of large dimensions
were built with a series of drums. At Selinus in Sicily some of
these great circular blocks are found on the road between the
quarries and the temples; they vary from 8 to 10 ft. in diameter,
being about 6 ft. high. The term <i>frusta</i> is sometimes applied to
them.</p>

<p>In music the drum (Fr. <i>tambour</i>; Ger. <i>Trommel</i>; Ital. <i>tamburo</i>)
is an instrument of percussion common in some form to all
nations and ages. It consists of a frame or vessel forming a
resonant cavity, over one or both ends of which is stretched a
skin or vellum set in vibration by direct percussion of hand or
stick. Drums fall into two divisions according to the nature of
their sonority:&mdash;(1) instruments producing sounds of definite
musical pitch, and qualified thereby to take part in the harmony
of the orchestra, such as the kettledrum (<i>q.v.</i>); (2) instruments
of indefinite sonorousness, and therefore excluded from the
harmony of the orchestra; such are the bass drum, the side
or snare drum, the tenor drum, the tambourine, all used for
marking the rhythm and adding tone colour.</p>

<p>Drums are further divided into three classes according to
special features of construction:&mdash;(1) instruments having a
skin stretched over one end of the resonant cavity, the other
being open, such as the tambourine (<i>q.v.</i>) and the <i>darabukkeh</i>
or Egyptian drum, shaped like a mushroom; (2) instruments
consisting of a cup-shaped receptacle of metal, wood or earthenware
entirely closed by a skin or vellum stretched across the
opening, as in the kettledrum; (3) a receptacle in the shape of a
cylinder closed at both ends by skins, as in the bass drum, side
drum, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Skin or parchment only acquires the elasticity requisite to
produce vibration by tension; the vibrations of the parchment
are taken up by the air enclosed in the receptacle, which thus
reinforces the sound produced by the parchment. The <i>tone</i> of
the instrument whether definite or indefinite depends upon the
dimensions of the vellum, the shape of the resonant receptacle,
and the method of percussion. The <i>intensity</i> of the sound
depends upon the degree of percussive force used and the diameter
of the vellum in proportion to the dimensions of the
resonant receptacle; the material of which the latter consists
has little or no influence on the tone of the instrument. The
<i>pitch</i> of the sound is determined by the dimensions of the vellum
taken in conjunction with the degree of tension, the pitch
varying in acuteness directly with the degree of tension and
inversely with the size of the vellum.</p>

<p>The <i>bass drum</i> or Turkish drum (Fr. <i>grosse caisse</i>; Ger. <i>Grosse
Trommel</i>; Ital. <i>gran cassa</i> or <i>tamburo grande</i>) consists of a
short cylinder of very wide diameter covered at both ends by
vellum stretched over thin hoops, which in turn are kept in place
by larger hoops fitting
tightly over them. At
regular intervals in the
two large hoops are
bored holes through
which passes an endless
cord stretched in zig-zag
round the cylinder and
connecting the two
hoops. The tension of
the vellum is controlled
by means of leather
braces which are made
to slide up and down
the zig-zag of cord,
slackening or tightening
the large hoops, and
with them the vellum,
at the will of the performer.
Systems of rods
and screws are also used
for the purpose. The
bass drum is mounted on a stand when used in the orchestra.
The sound is produced by striking the centre of the vellum on
the one end of the drum with a stick having a large soft round
knob composed of wood covered with cork, sponge or felt. The
bass drum cannot be tuned since it gives out no definite note, but
the pitch may be varied, according as a rich full tone or a
mere dull thud be required, by tightening or loosening the
braces; the instrument can, moreover, be muffled by covering
it with a piece of cloth. The music for the bass drum is generally
written on a stave with a bass clef, <img style="width:80px; height:34px" src="images/img598b.jpg" alt="" />, the C being
merely used to show the rhythm and accents. Sometimes
the stave is dispensed with, a single note on a single
line being sufficient. The bass drum has a place in every
orchestra, although it is used but sparingly to accentuate the
rhythm. It is possible to make gradations in <i>forte</i> and <i>piano</i>
on the bass drum, and to play quavers and semi-quavers in
moderate <i>tempo</i>. A roll is sometimes played by holding a short
stick, furnished with a knob at each end, in the middle and
striking in quick succession with each knob alternately; two
kettledrum sticks answer the purpose still better. It is understood
that the cymbals play the same music as the bass drum
unless the composer has written <i>senza piatti</i> over the part.
Wagner did not once score for the bass drum after he composed
<i>Rienzi</i>, but Verdi, Gounod, Berlioz and Sullivan used it effectively.
The bass drum was formerly known as the <i>long drum</i>,
the cylinder being long in proportion to the diameter.</p>

<p>The <i>side</i> or <i>snare drum</i> (Fr. <i>tambour militaire</i>; Ger. <i>Militärtrommel</i>;
Ital. <i>tamburo militare</i>) is an instrument consisting of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page599" id="page599"></a>599</span>
a small wooden or brass cylinder with a vellum at each end.
The parchments are lapped over small hoops and pressed firmly
down by larger hoops. As in the bass drum, these and the
vellums are tightened or slackened by means of cords and leather
braces, or by a system of rods and screws. Across the lower head
are stretched two or more catgut strings called snares, which
produce a rattling sound at each stroke on the upper head,
owing to the sympathetic vibration of the lower head which
jars against the snares. The upper head, set in vibration by
direct percussion from the sticks, induces sympathetic vibrations
in the air contained within the resonating receptacle, and these
vibrations are communicated to the lower head. The presence
of the snares across the diameter of the latter produces a phenomenon
which gives the side drum its peculiar timbre, changing
the nature of the vibrations, now no longer free: the snares
form a kind of nodal contact, inducing double the number of
vibrations and a sound approximately an octave higher than
would be the case were the heads left to vibrate freely. Moreover,
the vibrations of the upper head being weaker, the latter
is compelled to vibrate synchronously with the lower vellum.<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>The side drum, so called because it is worn at the side, is
struck in the centre by two small wooden sticks with elongated
heads or knobs of hard wood, producing a hard rasping sound
when the drum is played singly and in close proximity to the
hearer; when, however, several drums are played simultaneously
or with other instruments the effect is brilliant and exhilarating.
The roll is produced by striking two blows alternately with each
hand quite regularly and very rapidly, the result being a rattling
tremolo. This roll (&ldquo;daddy-mammy&rdquo;) is very difficult to
acquire, and requires long practice. The side drum can be
muffled by loosening the snares or by inserting a piece of silk
or cloth between the snares and the parchment. An impressive
effect is produced by a continued roll on muffled drums in funeral
marches. The notation for the side drum is similar to that in use
for the bass drum; the value of the note is alone of importance;
the place of the note on the staff is immaterial and purely a
matter of custom. In orchestral scores, a single line is often
used, or the part for side and bass drum is written on the same
staff. A great variety of rhythmical figures can be played on the
side drum, such as</p>

<p>The <i>tenor drum</i> (Fr. <i>caisse roulante</i>; Ger. <i>Roll-</i> or <i>Rührtrommel</i>;
Ital. <i>tamburo rulante</i>) is similar to the side drum but has a larger
cylinder of wood and no snares; consequently its timbre lacks
the brilliancy and incisiveness of the side drum. It is used for
the roll in military bands, in some theatre orchestras, and on the
stage.</p>

<p>The <i>tambourin de Provence</i> is a small drum with a long cylinder
of narrow diameter used in the Basque provinces with a small
pipe (<i>galoubet</i>) having three holes. The drum is beaten with one
stick only, the performer steadying it with the hand which fingers
the pipe. The tambourin and galoubet are in fact a survival of
the pipe and tabor (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>The popularity of all kinds of drums in the most ancient
civilizations is established beyond a doubt by the numerous
representations of the instrument in a variety of shapes and
sizes on the monuments and paintings of Egypt, Assyria,
India and Persia. The <i>tympanon</i>, under which name seem to
have been included tambourines and kettledrums, as well as
the dulcimer (during the middle ages), was in use among Greeks
and Romans chiefly in the worship of Cybele and Bacchus; it
was introduced through the medium of the Roman civilization
into western Europe. It is often said that the drum was introduced
by the crusaders, but it was certainly known in England
long before the crusades, for Bede (<i>Musica practica</i>) mentions
it in his list of instruments, and Cassiodorus (ii. p. 507) describes
it. The side drum was, until the reign of Elizabeth, of a much
larger size than now and was held horizontally and beaten on
one head only. It is not known at what date snares were added;
Praetorius (<i>Syntagma musicum</i>, 1618) and Mersenne (<i>L&rsquo;Harmonie
universelle</i>, Paris, 1636) both mention them. A drawing of a side
drum showing a snare appears in a book<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a> from the printing press
of J. Badius Ascensius (1510); the instrument also has cords
and braces. Another woodcut of the same century is given as
frontispiece to an edition of Flavius Vegetius Renatus.<a name="fa3e" id="fa3e" href="#ft3e"><span class="sp">3</span></a> An actual
side drum with two curved drumsticks belonging to the ancient
Egyptians was found during the excavations conducted at Thebes
in 1823.<a name="fa4e" id="fa4e" href="#ft4e"><span class="sp">4</span></a> It measured 1½ ft. in height by 2 ft. in diameter; the
tension of the heads was regulated by cords braced by means of
catgut encircling both ends of the drum, and wound separately
round each cord so that these could be tightened or slackened
at will by pulling the catgut bands closer together or pushing
them farther apart. The Berlin Museum possesses some ancient
Egyptian straight drumsticks with handle and knob. Drums
were used at the battle of Halidon Hill (1333). An old ballad
celebrating Edward III.&rsquo;s victory on this occasion appears in a
chronicle of the 14th century, preserved in the British Museum
(Harl. MS. 4690),</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRUMMOND, HENRY<a name="ar64" id="ar64"></a></span> (1786-1860), English banker, politician
and writer, best known as one of the founders of the Catholic
Apostolic or &ldquo;Irvingite&rdquo; Church, was born at the Grange, near
Alresford, Hampshire, on the 5th of December 1786. He was the
eldest son of Henry Drummond, a prominent London banker,
by a daughter of the first Lord Melville. He was educated at
Harrow and at Christ Church, Oxford, but took no degree. His
name is permanently connected with the university through the
chair of political economy which he founded in 1825. He
entered parliament in early life, and took an active interest from
the first in nearly all departments of politics. Thoroughly
independent and often eccentric in his views, he yet acted
generally with the Conservative party. His speeches were often
almost inaudible but were generally lucid and informing, and on
occasion caustic and severe. From 1847 until his death in
1860 he represented West Surrey in parliament. Drummond
took a deep interest in religious subjects, and published numerous
books and pamphlets on such questions as the interpretation of
prophecy, the circulation of the Apocrypha, the principles of
Christianity, &amp;c., which attracted considerable attention. In
1817 he met Robert Haldane at Geneva, and continued his
movement against the Socinian tendencies then prevalent in
that city. In later years he was intimately associated with the
origin and spread of the Catholic Apostolic Church. Meetings
of those who sympathized with the views of Edward Irving
were held for the study of prophecy at Drummond&rsquo;s seat,
Albury Park, in Surrey; he contributed very liberally to the
funds of the new church; and he became one of its leading
office-bearers, visiting Scotland as an &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; and being
ordained as an &ldquo;angel&rdquo; for that kingdom. The numerous
works he wrote in defence of its distinctive doctrines and practice
were generally clear and vigorous, if seldom convincing. He
died on the 20th of February 1860.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRUMMOND, HENRY<a name="ar65" id="ar65"></a></span> (1851-1897), Scottish evangelical
writer and lecturer, was born in Stirling on the 17th of August
1851. He was educated at Edinburgh University, where he
displayed a strong inclination for physical and mathematical
science. The religious element was an even more powerful
factor in his nature, and disposed him to enter the Free Church
of Scotland. While preparing for the ministry, he became for
a time deeply interested in the evangelizing mission of Moody
and Sankey, in which he actively co-operated for two years. In
1877 he became lecturer on natural science in the Free Church
College, which enabled him to combine all the pursuits for which
he felt a vocation. His studies resulted in his writing <i>Natural
Law in the Spiritual World</i>, the argument of which was that the
scientific principle of continuity extended from the physical
world to the spiritual. Before the book issued from the press
(1883), a sudden invitation from the African Lakes Company
drew Drummond away to Central Africa. Upon his return in
the following year he found himself famous. Large bodies of
serious readers, alike among the religious and the scientific
classes, discovered in <i>Natural Law</i> the common standing-ground
which they needed; and the universality of the demand proved,
if nothing more, the seasonableness of its publication. Drummond
continued to be actively interested in missionary and other
movements among the Free Church students. In 1888 he
published <i>Tropical Africa</i>, a valuable digest of information.
In 1890 he travelled in Australia, and in 1893 delivered the
Lowell Lectures at Boston. It had been his intention to reserve
them for mature revision, but an attempted piracy compelled
him to hasten their publication, and they appeared in 1894
under the title of <i>The Ascent of Man</i>. Their object was to vindicate
for altruism, or the disinterested care and compassion
of animals for each other, an important part in effecting &ldquo;the
survival of the fittest,&rdquo; a thesis previously maintained by
Professor John Fiske. Drummond&rsquo;s health failed shortly afterwards,
and he died on the 11th of March 1897. His character
was full of charm. His writings were too nicely adapted to the
needs of his own day to justify the expectation that they would
long survive it, but few men exercised more religious influence
in their own generation, especially on young men.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRUMMOND, THOMAS<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> (1797-1840), British inventor and
administrator, was born at Edinburgh on the 10th of October
1797, and was educated at the high school there. He was
appointed to a cadetship at the Royal Military Academy,
Woolwich, in 1813; and in 1815 he entered the Royal Engineers.
In 1819, when meditating the renunciation of military service
for the bar, he made the acquaintance of Colonel T. F. Colby
(1784-1852), from whom in the following year he received an
appointment on the trigonometrical survey of Great Britain.
During his winters in London he attended the chemical lectures
of W. T. Brande and M. Faraday at the Royal Institution, and
the mention at one of these of the brilliant luminosity of lime
when incandescent suggested to him the employment of the lime
light for making distant surveying stations visible. In 1825,
when he was assisting Colby in the Irish survey, his lime-light
apparatus (&ldquo;Drummond light&rdquo;) was put to a practical test,
and enabled observations to be completed between Divis
mountain, near Belfast, and Slieve Snaght, a distance of 67 m.
About the same time he also devised an improved heliostat, and
in 1829 he was employed in adopting his light for lighthouse
purposes. In 1831 he entered political life and was appointed
superintendent of the boundary commission. Four years later
he was made under-secretary of state for Ireland, where he
proved himself a most successful administrator, and did much
to promote law and order. It was he who in 1838 told the Irish
landlords that &ldquo;property has its duties as well as its rights.&rdquo;
In 1836 he proposed the appointment of a commission on railways
in Ireland, and took a large share in its work, which resulted
in the recommendation, not, however, carried out, that the state
should construct a system of lines throughout the island.
Drummond&rsquo;s health was undermined by overwork, and he died
at Dublin on the 15th of April 1840.</p>

on the 13th of December 1585. His father, John Drummond, was
the first laird of Hawthornden; and his mother was Susannah
Fowler, sister of William Fowler (<i>q.v.</i>), poet and courtier.
Drummond received his early education at the high school of
Edinburgh, and graduated in July 1605 as M.A. of the recently
founded university of Edinburgh. His father was a gentleman
usher at the English court (as he had been at the Scottish court
from 1590) and William, in a visit to London in 1606, describes
the festivities in connexion with the visit of the king of Denmark.
Drummond spent two years at Bourges and Paris in the study
of law; and, in 1609, he was again in Scotland, where, by the
death of his father in the following year, he became laird of
Hawthornden at the early age of twenty-four. The list of books
he read up to this time is preserved in his own handwriting.
It indicates a strong preference for imaginative literature, and
shows that he was keenly interested in contemporary verse.
His collection (now in the library of the university of Edinburgh)
contains many first editions of the most famous productions of
the age. On finding himself his own master, Drummond naturally
abandoned law for the muses; &ldquo;for,&rdquo; says his biographer in
1711, &ldquo;the delicacy of his wit always run on the pleasantness
and usefulness of history, and on the fame and softness of
poetry.&rdquo; In 1612 began his correspondence with Sir William
Alexander of Menstrie, afterwards earl of Stirling (<i>q.v.</i>), which
ripened into a life-long friendship after Drummond&rsquo;s visit to
Menstrie in 1614.</p>

<p>Drummond&rsquo;s first publication appeared in 1613, an elegy on
the death of Henry, prince of Wales, called <i>Teares on the Death
of Meliades</i> (<i>Moeliades</i>, 3rd edit. 1614). The poem shows the
influence of Spenser&rsquo;s and Sidney&rsquo;s pastoralism. In the same
year he published an anthology of the elegies of Chapman,
Wither and others, entitled <i>Mausoleum</i>, or <i>The Choisest Flowres
of the Epitaphs</i>. In 1616, the year of Shakespeare&rsquo;s death,
appeared <i>Poems: Amorous, Funerall, Divine, Pastorall: in
Sonnets, Songs, Sextains, Madrigals</i>, being substantially the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page601" id="page601"></a>601</span>
story of his love for Mary Cunningham of Barns, who was about
to become his wife when she died in 1615. The poems bear
marks of a close study of Sidney, and of the Italian poets. He
sometimes translates direct from the Italian, especially from
Marini. <i>Forth Feasting: A Panegyricke to the King&rsquo;s Most
Excellent Majestie</i> (1617), a poem written in heroic couplets of
remarkable facility, celebrates James&rsquo;s visit to Scotland in that
year. In 1618 Drummond began a correspondence with Michael
Drayton. The two poets continued to write at intervals for
thirteen years, the last letter being dated in the year of Drayton&rsquo;s
death. The latter had almost been persuaded by his &ldquo;dear
Drummond&rdquo; to print the later books of <i>Poly-Olbion</i> at Hart&rsquo;s
Edinburgh press. In the winter of 1618-1619, Drummond had
included Ben Jonson in his circle of literary friends, and at
Christmas 1618 was honoured with a visit of a fortnight or more
from the dramatist. The account of their conversations, long
supposed to be lost, was discovered in the Advocates&rsquo; Library,
Edinburgh, by David Laing, and was edited for the Shakespeare
Society in 1842 and printed by Gifford &amp; Cunningham. The
conversations are full of literary gossip, and embody Ben&rsquo;s
opinion of himself and of his host, whom he frankly told that
&ldquo;his verses were too much of the schooles, and were not after
the fancie of the time,&rdquo; and again that he &ldquo;was too good and
simple, and that oft a man&rsquo;s modestie made a fool of his witt.&rdquo;
But the publication of what was obviously intended merely
for a private journal has given Jonson an undeserved reputation
for harsh judgments, and has cast blame on Drummond for
blackening his guest&rsquo;s memory.</p>

<p>In 1623 appeared the poet&rsquo;s fourth publication, entitled
<i>Flowers of Sion: By William Drummond of Hawthornedenne:
to which is adjoyned his Cypresse Grove</i>. From 1625 till 1630
Drummond was probably for the most part engaged in travelling
on the Continent. In 1627, however, he seems to have been
home for a short time, as, in that year, he appears in the entirely
new character of the holder of a patent for the construction of
military machines, entitled &ldquo;Litera Magistri Gulielmi Drummond
de Fabrica Machinarum Militarium, Anno 1627.&rdquo; The same
year, 1627, is the date of Drummond&rsquo;s munificent gift (referred
to above) of about 500 volumes to the library of the university
of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>In 1630 Drummond again began to reside permanently at
Hawthornden, and in 1632 he married Elizabeth Logan, by
whom he had five sons and four daughters. In 1633 Charles
made his coronation-visit to Scotland; and Drummond&rsquo;s pen
was employed in writing congratulatory speeches and verses.
As Drummond preferred Episcopacy to Presbytery, and was an
extremely loyal subject, he supported Charles&rsquo;s general policy,
though he protested against the methods employed to enforce
it. When Lord Balmerino was put on his trial on the capital
charge of retaining in his possession a petition regarded as a
libel on the king&rsquo;s government, Drummond in an energetic
&ldquo;Letter&rdquo; (1635) urged the injustice and folly of the proceedings.
About this time a claim by the earl of Menteith to the earldom
of Strathearn, which was based on the assertion that Robert III.,
husband of Annabella Drummond, was illegitimate, roused the
poet&rsquo;s pride of blood and prompted him to prepare an historical
defence of his house. Partly to please his kinsman the earl
of Perth, and partly to satisfy his own curiosity, the poet made
researches in the genealogy of the family. This investigation
was the real secret of Drummond&rsquo;s interest in Scottish history;
and so we find that he now began his <i>History of Scotland during
the Reigns of the Five Jameses</i>, a work which did not appear till
1655, and is remarkable only for its good literary style. His next
work was called forth by the king&rsquo;s enforced submission to the
opposition of his Scottish subjects. It is entitled <i>Irene: or a
Remonstrance for Concord, Amity, and Love amongst His Majesty&rsquo;s
Subjects</i> (1638), and embodies Drummond&rsquo;s political creed of
submission to authority as the only logical refuge from democracy,
which he hated. In 1639 Drummond had to sign the Covenant
in self-protection, but was uneasy under the burden, as several
political squibs by him testify. In 1643 he published <span class="grk" title="Skiamachia">&#931;&#954;&#953;&#945;&#956;&#945;&#967;&#943;&#945;</span>:
<i>or a Defence of a Petition tendered to the Lords of the Council of
Scotland by certain Noblemen and Gentlemen</i>, a political pamphlet
in support of those royalists in Scotland who wished to espouse
the king&rsquo;s cause against the English parliament. Its burden is
an invective on the intolerance of the then dominant Presbyterian
clergy.</p>

<p>His later works may be described briefly as royalist pamphlets,
written with more or less caution, as the times required. Drummond
took the part of Montrose; and a letter from the Royalist
leader in 1646 acknowledged his services. He also wrote a
pamphlet, &ldquo;A Vindication of the Hamiltons,&rdquo; supporting the
claims of the duke of Hamilton to lead the Scottish army which
was to release Charles I. It is said that Drummond&rsquo;s health
received a severe shock when news was brought of the king&rsquo;s
execution. He died on the 4th of December 1649. He was
buried in his parish church of Lasswade.</p>

<p>Drummond&rsquo;s most important works are the <i>Cypresse Grove</i>
and the poems. The <i>Cypresse Grove</i> exhibits great wealth of
illustration, and an extraordinary command of musical English.
It is an essay on the folly of the fear of death. &ldquo;This globe of
the earth,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;which seemeth huge to us, in respect of
the universe, and compared with that wide pavilion of heaven,
is less than little, of no sensible quantity, and but as a point.&rdquo;
This is one of Drummond&rsquo;s favourite moods; and he uses
constantly in his poems such phrases as &ldquo;the All,&rdquo; &ldquo;this great
All.&rdquo; Even in such of his poems as may be called more distinctively
Christian, this philosophic conception is at work.</p>

<p>A noteworthy feature in Drummond&rsquo;s poetry, as in that of
his courtier contemporaries Ayton (<i>q.v.</i>), Lord Stirling and
others, is that it manifests no characteristic Scottish element,
but owes its birth and inspiration rather to the English and
Italian masters. Drummond was essentially a follower of
Spenser, but, amid all his sensuousness, and even in those lines
most conspicuously beautiful, there is a dash of melancholy
thoughtfulness&mdash;a tendency deepened by the death of his first
love, Mary Cunningham. Drummond was called &ldquo;the Scottish
Petrarch&rdquo;; and his sonnets, which are the expression of a
genuine passion, stand far above most of the contemporary
Petrarcan imitations. A remarkable burlesque poem <i>Polemo-Middinia
inter Vitarvam et Nebernam</i> (printed anonymously in
1684) has been persistently, and with good reason, ascribed to
him. It is a mock-heroic tale, in dog-Latin, of a country feud
on the Fifeshire lands of his old friends the Cunninghams.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Drummond&rsquo;s <i>Poems</i>, with <i>Cypresse Grove</i>, the <i>History</i>, and a few
of the minor tracts, were collected in 1656 and edited by Edward
Phillips, Milton&rsquo;s nephew. <i>The Works of William Drummond, of
Hawthornden</i> (1711), edited by Bishop Sage and Thomas Ruddiman,
contains a life by the former, and some of the poet&rsquo;s letters. A
handsome edition of the <i>Poems</i> was printed by the Maitland Club
in 1832. Later editions are by Peter Cunningham (1833), by
William R. Turnbull in &ldquo;The Library of Old Authors&rdquo; (1856), and
by W. C. Ward (1894) for &ldquo;The Muses&rsquo; Library.&rdquo; The standard
biography of Drummond is by David Masson (1873). Extracts from
the Hawthornden MSS. preserved in the Library of the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland were printed by David Laing in <i>Archaeologia
Scotica</i>, vol. iv.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DRUNKENNESS,<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> a term signifying generally a state resulting
from excessive drinking, and usually associated with alcoholic
intoxication, or alcohol poisoning. It may represent either an
<i>act</i> or a <i>habit</i>, the latter consisting in frequent repetitions of the
former. As an act it may be an accident, most usually arising
from the incautious use of one or other of the commonly employed
intoxicating agents; as a habit (as in the form of chronic
alcoholism) it is one of the most degrading forms of vice which
can result from the enfeeblement of the moral principle by
persistent self-indulgence.</p>

<p>What appears to be &ldquo;intoxication&rdquo; may arise from many
different causes (<i>e.g.</i> epilepsy, fractured skull, intracranial
haemorrhage, and the toxaemic coma of diabetes and uraemia),
and the close resemblance between the pathological and the
toxic phenomena has been the cause of many untoward accidents.
Cold alone may produce such peculiar effects that Captain Parry
said in his <i>Journal</i>, &ldquo;I cannot help thinking that many a man
may have been punished for intoxication who was only suffering
from the benumbing effects of frost; for I have more than once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page602" id="page602"></a>602</span>
seen our people in a state so exactly resembling that of the most
stupid intoxication, that I should certainly have charged them
with the offence had I not been quite sure that no possible means
were afforded them on Melville Island to procure anything
stronger than snow water.&rdquo; The same confusion is frequently
found in cases which come before the police-courts, people being
arrested as &ldquo;drunk and disorderly&rdquo; who can prove that the
symptoms were not due to over-indulgence in drink at all.
Some individuals have, moreover, a special idiosyncrasy or
susceptibility to alcohol, due to heredity or to one of the sequelae
of sunstroke or cranial injury. The children of drunkards are
usually very susceptible to the poison, becoming intoxicated by
a far smaller quantity than is needed by a normal person.</p>

<p>But, as a rule, the phenomena of drunkenness are actually
due to excessive consumption of some intoxicating liquid.
The physiological action of all such agents may be described as
a cumulative production of paralysis of various parts of the
nervous system, but this effect results only in doses of a certain
amount&mdash;a dose which varies with the agent, the race and the
individual. Even the cup so often said to &ldquo;cheer, but not
inebriate,&rdquo; cannot be regarded as altogether free from the last-named
effect. Tea-sots are well known to be affected with
palpitation and irregularity of the heart, as well as with more
or less sleeplessness, mental irritability and muscular tremors,
which in some culminate in paralysis; while positive intoxication
has been known to be the result of the excessive use of strong tea.
In short, from tea to haschisch we have, through hops, alcohol,
tobacco and opium, a sort of graduated scale of intoxicants,
which stimulate in small doses and narcotize in larger,&mdash;the
narcotic dose having no stimulating properties whatever, and
only appearing to possess them from the fact that the agent can
only be gradually taken up by the blood, and the system thus
comes primarily under the influence of a stimulant dose. In
certain circumstances and with certain agents&mdash;as in the production
of chloroform narcosis&mdash;this precursory stage is capable
of being much abbreviated, if not altogether annihilated; while
with other agents&mdash;as tea&mdash;the narcotic stage is by no means
always or readily produced.</p>

<p>No subject in modern times has led to more extreme opinions
than this of indulgence in &ldquo;intoxicants&rdquo; to any degree whatever.
It is well to remember that (in spite of apparently authoritative
modern views to the contrary) there is not a shadow of proof
that the moderate use of any one of these agents as a stimulant
has any definite tendency to lead to its abuse; it is otherwise
with their employment as narcotics, which, once indulged in, is
almost certain to lead to repetition, and to a more or less rapid
process of degradation, though there are many exceptions to
this latter statement. It is interesting to know that a former
English judge, who lived to nearly ninety years of age, believed he
had prolonged his life and added greatly to his comfort by the
moderate use of ether, which he was led to employ because
neither wine nor tobacco agreed with him; while the immoderate
use of the same agent has given rise to a most deleterious form
of drunkenness, both in parts of Ireland and in some of the large
industrial centres in Great Britain.</p>

<p>Various modern biologists have discussed, with more or less
acceptance in certain circles, the historical conditions in various
races and in different countries as to the use and abuse of intoxicants,
and have drawn varying conclusions from their
theories. It has even been contended, with much show of learned
authority, that since drunkenness leads to disease and early
death, the proneness to strong drink in the long run causes the
elimination of the unfit, and results in a general sobering of the
community, a race being therefore temperate in proportion to
its past sufferings through alcohol. But on this subject it may
be said that, at least, no agreement has been reached.</p>

<p>The effects of intoxicants are variously modified by the temperament
of the individual and the nature of the inebriant.
When that is alcohol, its action on an average individual is first
to fill him with a serene and perfect self-complacency. His
feelings and faculties are exalted into a state of great activity
and buoyancy, so that his language becomes enthusiastic, and
his conversation vivacious if not brilliant. The senses gradually
become hazy, a soft humming seems to fill the pauses of the
conversation, and modify the tones of the speaker, a filmy haze
obscures the vision, the head seems lighter than usual, the
equilibrium unstable. By-and-by objects appear double, or flit
confusedly before the eyes; judgment is abolished, secretiveness
annihilated, and the drunkard pours forth all that is
within him with unrestrained communicativeness; he becomes
boisterous, ridiculous, and sinks at length into a mere animal.
Every one around him, the very houses, trees, even the earth
itself, seem drunken and unstable, he alone sober, till at last the
final stage is reached, and he falls on the ground insensible&mdash;<i>dead
drunk</i> (alcoholic coma)&mdash;a state from which, after profound
slumber, he at last awakes feverish, exhausted, sick and giddy,
with ringing ears, a throbbing heart and a violent headache.</p>

<p>The poison primarily affects the cerebral lobes, and the other
parts of the cerebro-spinal system are consecutively involved, till
in the state of <i>dead-drunkenness</i> the only parts not invaded by
a benumbing paralysis are those automatic centres in the medulla
oblongata which regulate and maintain the circulation and
respiration. But even these centres are not unaffected; the
paralysis of these as of the other sections of the cerebro-spinal
system varies in its incompleteness, and at times becomes
complete, the coma of drunkenness terminating in death. More
usually the intoxicant is gradually eliminated, and the individual
restored to consciousness, a consciousness disturbed by the
secondary results of the agent he has abused, which vary with
the nature of that agent. Whether, however, directly or indirectly
through the nervous system, the stomach suffers in
every case; thus nutrition is interfered with by the defective
ingestion of food, as well as by the mal-assimilation of that
which is ingested; and from this cause, as well as by the peculiar
local action of the various poisons, the various organic degenerations
are induced (cirrhosis of the liver, &amp;c.) which in most cases
shorten the drunkard&rsquo;s days.</p>

<p>The primary discomforts of an act of drunkenness are readily
removed for the time by a repetition of the cause. Thus what
has been an act may readily become a habit, all the more readily
that each repetition more and more enfeebles both the will and
the judgment, till they become utterly unfit to resist the
temptation to indulgence supplied by the knowledge of the
temporary relief to suffering which is sure to follow, and in spite
of the consciousness that each repetition of the act only forges
their chains more tightly. From this condition there is no hope
of relief but in enforced abstinence; any one in this condition
must be regarded as temporarily insane (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Insanity</a></span> and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Neuropathology</a></span>), and ought to be placed in an inebriate
asylum till he regain sufficient self-control to enable him to
overcome his love for drink. Numerous &ldquo;cures&rdquo; have been
started in recent years, which have often succeeded in individual
cases. An anti-alcoholic serum obtained from alcoholized
horses has been advocated by Dr Sapelier.</p>

<p>For the law concerning drunkenness the reader is referred to
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Inebriety, Law of</a></span>. Its prevalence as a vice has varied considerably
according to the state of education or comfort in
different classes of society. In considering the extent to which
intemperance has prevailed, the statistics of prosecutions upon
which such comparisons are usually based are far from being
completely satisfactory, but, inasmuch as they constitute the
only possible data for such comparisons, we are compelled to
accept them. The following table gives the average number
of persons per 1000 of the population proceeded against for
drunkenness in England and Wales for quinquennial periods,
dating from 1857, the first year of the Judicial Statistics:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page603" id="page603"></a>603</span></p>

<p>The figures, it will be seen, show a steady decline from 1872-1876
(when the consumption of alcohol was quite abnormal)
to 1892-1896. After that year, however, the figures again rose.
The increase was especially marked in 1899, when a tide of
exceptional prosperity was again accompanied by great drunkenness.
It is also disquieting to discover that the average number
of prosecutions for drunkenness in the three years 1897-1899
was 51% higher than the average for 1857-1861, and 35%
higher than the average for 1862-1866. That the increase was
partly due to more efficient police administration is probable,
but that this is not a complete explanation of the figures is
made evident by an analysis of the general statistics of crime
during the same period, from which it may be seen that, while
crime generally (excluding drunkenness) decreased 28% in
England and Wales since 1857-1861, drunkenness increased
51%. Speaking generally, it may be said that in the United
Kingdom drunkenness appears chiefly prevalent in the seaport
and mining districts. If a line be drawn from the mouth of the
Severn to the Wash, it will be found that the &ldquo;black&rdquo; counties,
without exception, lie to the north-west of this line. The worst
counties in England and Wales in the matter of drunkenness
are Northumberland, Durham and Glamorganshire, while
Pembrokeshire and Lancashire follow close behind. The most
sober counties, on the other hand, are Cambridgeshire, Suffolk,
Oxfordshire and Wiltshire. Averages based upon the returns
of entire counties do not, however, afford a complete guide to
the distribution of drunkenness, inasmuch as offences are not
equally distributed over the whole area of a county. A heavy
ratio of drunkenness in a small district may often give a county
an unfavourable position in the general averages, notwithstanding
favourable conditions in the rest of its area.</p>

<p>Analysis of the prosecutions for drunkenness shows that about
24% of the total number of offences are committed by women.
In the larger towns the proportion, as a rule, is higher. In
London, 38% of the drunkenness is attributable to women;
in Manchester, 36%; in Belfast and Glasgow, 32%. In
Liverpool, on the other hand, the proportion is only 24%.
The much-controverted question as to whether intemperance
is increasing among women can hardly, however, be decided
by an appeal to the criminal statistics. So far as these statistics
throw any light at all upon the question, they suggest important
local differences. A more direct clue is afforded by the registrar-general&rsquo;s
annual returns of deaths directly attributed to intemperance.
The figures are given below. In order to eliminate
accidental variations, the comparison is based upon the average
mortality during consecutive periods:&mdash;</p>

<p>For the ten years ending 1904, out of 26,426 deaths from
alcoholism, 59.34% were males and 40.66% females.</p>

<p>The figures are certainly striking. They show, it will be noticed,
that out of every 100 deaths from alcoholic excess in England
and Wales women contributed nine more at the end of the
century then they did in 1880. If, instead of taking the total
number of deaths, we take the ratio per million persons living,
the increase is seen even more clearly:&mdash;</p>

<p>It appears that, while the ratio of mortality from alcoholic
excess increased 87% among males during the last two
decades of the century, among females it increased by no less
than 180%.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRURY, SIR WILLIAM<a name="ar69" id="ar69"></a></span> (1527-1579), English statesman and
soldier, was a son of Sir Robert Drury of Hedgerley in Buckinghamshire,
and grandson of another Sir Robert Drury (d. 1536),
who was speaker of the House of Commons in 1495. He was
born at Hawstead in Suffolk on the 2nd of October 1527, and
was educated at Gonville Hall, Cambridge. Fighting in France,
Drury was taken prisoner in 1544; then after his release he
helped Lord Russell, afterwards earl of Bedford, to quell a rising
in Devonshire in 1549, but he did not come to the front until
the reign of Elizabeth. In 1559 he was sent to Edinburgh to
report on the condition of Scottish politics, and five years
later he became marshal and deputy-governor of Berwick. Again
in Scotland in January 1570, it is interesting to note that the
regent James Stewart, earl of Murray, was proceeding to keep
an appointment with Drury in Linlithgow when he was mortally
wounded, and it was probably intended to murder the English
envoy also. After this event Drury led two raids into Scotland;
at least thrice he went to that country on more peaceable errands,
during which, however, his life was continually in danger from
assassins; and he commanded the force which compelled
Edinburgh Castle to surrender in May 1573. In 1576 he was
sent to Ireland as president of Munster, where his stern rule
was very successful, and in 1578 he became lord justice to the
Irish council, taking the chief control of affairs after the departure
of Sir Henry Sidney. The rising of the earl of Desmond had
just broken out when Sir William died in October 1579.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRUSES,<a name="ar70" id="ar70"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Druzes</span> (Arab. <i>Druz</i>), a people of mid-Syria (for
the derivation of the name see History section below), distributed
nowadays into three isolated groups, of which the most numerous
inhabits Jebel Hauran (Jebel Druz), E. of Jordan (about 55,000);
the second, the <i>cazas</i> of Shuf and Metn in Lebanon (about
50,000); the third, the <i>cazas</i> of Hasbeya, Rasheya, W. al Ajem,
Homs, Hamadiyeh and Selimiyeh in Anti-Lebanon and Hermon
(about 45,000). The first group, which has been greatly increased
by migrants from the second, since the establishment of the
privileged Lebanon province (1861) under Christian auspices,
lives apart from other peoples in semi-independence. The
second is now confined to the southern Lebanon, and even there
is greatly outnumbered by Maronites, who, in the whole &ldquo;Mountain,&rdquo;
stand to Druses as 9 to 2. The third is counterbalanced
everywhere by a large population of Moslem and Orthodox
Syrians. The Hauran, therefore, has become the stronghold
of the Druses, offering nowadays the best field for studying
their peculiar customs and religion; and the group there still
increases at the expense of the other groups, despite efforts on
the part of the Ottoman government to check Druse migration
by both conciliatory and repressive measures. The actual
distinction of the Druses, as a racial unity, despite their dispersion,
depends so exclusively on the peculiarity of their common
religion, that it will be well at once to give an account of Druse
creed and practice as they are understood to stand at the present
day. How this religion may have grown up and come to be
theirs will be considered later.</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i>&mdash;Druse religion is a secret faith, and the following
account is given with all reserves. There are many indications
that a more primitive cult, containing elements of Nature
worship, preceded it, and still survives in the popular practices
of the more remote Druse districts, <i>e.g.</i> in the eastern Hauran.
The <i>Muwahhidin</i> (Unitarians), as the Druses call themselves,
believe that there is one and only one God, indefinable, incomprehensible,
ineffable, passionless. He has made himself known
to men by successive incarnations, of which the last was Hakim,
the sixth Fatimite caliph. How many these incarnations have
been is stated variously; but seventy, one for each period of
the world, seems the best-attested number. Jesus appears to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page604" id="page604"></a>604</span>
be accepted as one such incarnation, but not Mahomet, although
it is agreed that, in his time, the &ldquo;Universal Intelligence&rdquo;
(see later) was made flesh, in the person of Mikdad al-Aswad.
No further incarnation can now take place: in Hakim a final
appeal was made to mankind, and after the door of mercy had
stood open to all for twenty-six years, it was finally and for ever
closed. When the tribulation of the faithful has reached its
height, Hakim will reappear to conquer the world and render
his religion supreme. Druses, believed to be dispersed in China,
will return to Syria. The combined body of the Faithful will
take Mecca, and finally Jerusalem, and all the world will accept
the Faith. The first of the creatures of God is the Universal
Intelligence or Spirit, impersonated in Hamza, Hakim&rsquo;s vizier.
This Spirit was the creator of all subordinate beings, and alone
has immediate communion with the Deity. Next in rank, and
equally supporting the throne of the Almighty, are four Ministering
Spirits, the Soul, the Word, the Right Wing and the Left
Wing, who, in Hakim&rsquo;s time, were embodied respectively in
Ismael Darazi, Mahommed ibn Wahab, Selama ibn Abd al-Wahal
and Baha ud-Din; and beneath these again are spiritual
agents of various ranks. The material world is an emanation
from, and a &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; of, the Divine Intelligence. The number
of human beings admits neither of increase nor of decrease,
and a regular process of metempsychosis goes on continually.
The souls of the virtuous pass after death into ever new incarnations
of greater perfection, till at last they reach a point at
which they can be re-absorbed into the Deity itself; those of
the wicked may be degraded to the level of camels or dogs. All
previous religions are mere types of the true, and their sacred
books and observances are to be interpreted allegorically. The
Gospel and the Koran are both regarded as inspired books, but
not as religious guides. The latter function is performed solely
by the Druse Scriptures. As the admission of converts is no
longer permitted, the faithful are enjoined to keep their doctrine
secret from the profane; and in order that their allegiance may
not bring them into danger, they are allowed (like Persian
mystics) to make outward profession of whatever religion is
dominant around them. To this latter indulgence is to be
attributed the apparent indifferentism which leads to their
joining Moslems in prayers and ablutions, or sprinkling themselves
with holy water in Maronite churches. Obedience is required
to the seven commandments of Hamza, the first and greatest
of which enjoins truth in words (but only those of Druse speaking
with Druse); the second, watchfulness over the safety of the
brethren; the third, absolute renunciation of every other
religion; the fourth, complete separation from all who are in
error; the fifth, recognition of the unity of &ldquo;Our Lord&rdquo; in all
ages; the sixth, complete resignation to his will; and the
seventh, complete obedience to his orders. Prayer, however,
is regarded as an impertinent interference with the Creator;
while, at the same time, instead of the fatalistic predestination
of Mahommedanism, the freedom of the human will is distinctly
maintained. Not only is the charge of secrecy rigidly obeyed
in regard to the alien world, but full initiation into the deeper
mysteries of the creed is permitted only to a special class designated
<i>Akils</i>, (Arabic <i>&lsquo;Akl</i>, intelligence), in contradistinction from
whom all other members of the Druse community, whatever
may be their position or attainments, are called <i>Jahel</i>, the
Ignorant. About 15% of the adult population belong to the
order of Akils. Admission is granted to any Druse of either
sex who expresses willingness to conform to the laws of the
society, and during a year of probation gives sufficient proof of
sincerity and stability of purpose. There appears to be no
formal distinction of rank among the various members; and
though the amir, Beshir Shehab, used to appoint a sheikh of the
Akils, the person thus distinguished obtained no primacy over
his fellows. Exceptional influence depends upon exceptional
sanctity or ability. All are required to abstain from tobacco
and wine; the women used not to be allowed to wear gold or
silver, or silk or brocade, but this rule is commonly broken now;
and although neither celibacy nor retirement from the affairs
of the world is either imperative or customary, unusual respect
is shown to those who voluntarily submit themselves to ascetic
discipline. While the Akils mingle frankly with the common
people, and are remarkably free from clerical pretension, they
are none the less careful to maintain their privileges. They
are distinguished by the wearing of a white turban, emblematic
of the purity of their life. Their food must be purchased with
money lawfully acquired; and lest they should unwittingly
partake of any that is ceremonially unclean, they require those
Jahels, whose hospitality they share, to supply their wants from
a store set apart for their exclusive use. The ideal Akil is grave,
calm and dignified, with an infinite capacity of keeping a secret,
and a devotion that knows no limits to the interests of his
creed. On Thursday evening, the commencement of the weekly
day of rest, the members of the order meet together in the
various districts, probably for the reading of their sacred books
and consultation on matters of ecclesiastical or political importance.
Their meeting-houses, <i>khalwas</i>, are plain, unornamented
edifices. These have property attached to them, the revenues
of which are consecrated to the relief of the poor and the demands
of hospitality. In the eastern Hauran, there are hill-top
shrines containing each a black stone, on which rugs, &amp;c., are
hung, and these seem to perpetuate features of pre-Islamic
Arabian cult, including the sacrifice of animals, <i>e.g.</i> goats. They
are held in reverence by the Bedouins. The women assemble
in the <i>khalwas</i> at the same time as the men, a part of the space
being fenced off for them by a semi-transparent black veil.
Even while the Akils are assembled, strangers are readily enough
admitted to the <i>khalwas</i>; but as long as these are present the
ordinary ceremonies are neglected, and the Koran takes the
place of the Druse Scriptures. It has been frequently asserted
that the image of a calf is kept in a niche, and traces of phallic
and gynaecocratic worship have been vaguely suspected;
but there is no authentic information in support of either statement.
The calf, if calf there be, is probably a symbol of the
execrable heresy of Darazi, who is frequently styled the calf by
his Orthodox opponents. Ignorance is the mother of suspicion
as well as of superstition; and accordingly the Christian inhabitants
of the Lebanon have long been persuaded that the
Druses in their secret assemblies are guilty of the most nefarious
practices. For this allegation, so frequently repeated by European
writers, there seems to be little evidence; and it is certain
that the sacred books of the religion contain moral teaching of a
high order on the whole.</p>

<p>As a formulated creed, the Druse system is not a thousand
years old. In the year <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 996 (386 A.H.) Hakim Biamrillahi
(<i>i.e.</i> he who judges by the command of God), sixth of the Fatimite
caliphs (third in Egypt), began to reign; and during the next
twenty-five years he indulged in a tyranny at once so terrible
and so fantastic that little doubt can be entertained of his
insanity. He believed that he held direct intercourse with the
deity, or even that he was an incarnation of the divine intelligence;
and in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1016 (407 <span class="sc">a.h.</span>) his claims were made known
in the mosque at Cairo, and supported by the testimony of
Ismael Darazi. The people showed such bitter hostility to the
new gospel that Darazi was compelled to seek safety in flight;
but even in absence he was faithful to his god, and succeeded
in winning over certain ignorant inhabitants of Lebanon. According
to the Druses, this great conversion took place in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1019
(410 <span class="sc">a.h.</span>). Meanwhile the endeavours of the caliph to get
his divinity acknowledged by the people of Cairo continued.
The advocacy of Hasan ibn Haidara Fergani was without
avail; but in 1017 (408 <span class="sc">a.h.</span>) the new religion found a more
successful apostle in the person of Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmed,
a Persian mystic, felt-maker by trade, who became Hakim&rsquo;s
vizier, gave form and substance to his creed, and by an ingenious
adaptation of its various dogmas to the prejudices of existing
sects, finally enlisted an extensive body of adherents. In 1020
(411 A.H.) the caliph was assassinated by contrivance of his
sister Sitt ul-Mulk; but it was given out by Hamza that he had
only withdrawn for a season, and his followers were encouraged to
look forward with confidence to his triumphant return. Darazi,
who had acted independently in his apostolate, was branded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page605" id="page605"></a>605</span>
by Hamza as a heretic, and thus, by a curious anomaly, he is
actually held in detestation by the very sect which perhaps
bears his name. The propagation of the faith in accordance
with Hamza&rsquo;s initiation was undertaken by Ismael ibn Mahommed
Tamimi, Mahommed ibn Wahab, Abul-Khair Selama ibn
Abd al-Wahal ibn Samurri, and Moktana Baha ud-Din, the
last of whom became known by his writings from Constantinople
to the borders of India. In two letters addressed to the emperors
Constantine VIII. and Michael the Paphlagonian he
endeavoured to prove that the Christian Messiah reappeared
in the person of Hamza.</p>

<p>It is possible, even probable, that the segregation of the
Druses as a people dates only from the adoption of Hamza&rsquo;s
creed. But when it is recalled that other inhabitants of the
same mountain system, <i>e.g.</i> the Maronites, the Ansarieh, the
Metawali and the &ldquo;Isma&lsquo;ilites,&rdquo; also profess creeds which, like
the Druse system, differ from Sunni Islam in the important
feature of admitting incarnations of the Deity, it is impossible
not to suspect that Hamza&rsquo;s emissaries only gave definition and
form to beliefs long established in this part of the world. Many
of the fundamental ideas of Druse theology belong to a common
West Asiatic stock; but the peculiar history of the Mountain
is no doubt responsible for beliefs, held elsewhere by different
peoples, being combined there in a single creed. Some allowance,
too, must be made for the probability that Hamza&rsquo;s system owed
something to doctrines Christian and other, with which the metropolitan
position of Cairo brought Fatimite society into contact.</p>

<p><i>History</i>&mdash;There is good reason to regard the Druses as, racially,
a mixture of refugee stocks, in which the Arab largely predominates,
grafted on to an original mountain population of Aramaic
blood and Incarnationist tendencies. The latter is represented
more purely by the Maronites (<i>q.v.</i>). The native tradition
regards an immigration of Hira Arabs into S. Lebanon, under
Khalid ibn Walid in the 9th century, as the beginning of Druse
distinctiveness and power; but it also accepts Turkoman and
Kurdish elements in the original Druse state. About the same
time, or a little later (in the reign of Saladin), it believes that
Hermon was colonized by a population of 15,000 Hira and
Yemenite Arabs, who had sojourned awhile in Hauran. The
name Druse is met with first in Benjamin of Tudela (c. <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1170),
and its origin has been much disputed. Some authorities see
in it a descriptive epithet, derived from Arabic <i>darasa</i> (those
who <i>read</i> the Book), or <i>darisa</i> (those in <i>possession</i> of Truth)
or <i>durs</i> (the <i>clever</i> or <i>initiated</i>); but more connect it with the
name of the first missionary, Ismael <i>Darazi</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as we begin to know anything of the Druses they were
living in a feudal state of society, as village communities under
<i>sheikhs</i>, themselves generally subordinate to one or more amirs.
In the time of the first crusades the main power was in the hands
of the Arslan family, which, however, suffered so severely in
wars with the Franks, that it was superseded by the Tnuhs, who,
holding Beirut and nearly all the Phoenician coast, came into
conflict with the sultans of Egypt. One of these latter, Malik
Ashraf, about <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1300, forced outward compliance with Sunni
Islam on the Mountain, after defeating the Druses at Ain Sofar.
Meanwhile, however, the <i>Maan</i> family, lately immigrant from
N. Arabia, was growing in power, and throwing in its lot with the
Osmanli invaders in the reign of Selim I., it was promoted to the
supreme amirate about 1517. Fakr ud-Din Maan II. increased
Druse dominion until it included all the N. Syrian region from
the edge of the Antioch plain to Acre, with part of the eastern
desert, dominated by his castle at Tadmor (Palmyra), and the
important towns of Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut and Saida; and
forming further ambitious designs, he intrigued with Christians
and broke with the Turks. In 1614 the pasha of Damascus
moved against him with a large force, and compelled him to fly
from Syria. He sought the courts of Tuscany and Naples and
tried to enlist Frank sympathies, inventing (probably) the
curious myth, so often credited since, that the Druses are of
crusading origin and owe their name to the counts of Dreux.<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
He landed again at Saida in 1619 and recovered his old position.
But in 1633 Kuchuk Ahmed Pasha was sent against him with
a large army, and succeeded in capturing him with his sons.
The family was sent to Constantinople, and two years later
strangled. The dynasty struggled on till the end of the century,
amid civil war, in which the parties seem to have been divided
by the earlier Arab factions of Kaisites (Qaisites) and Yemenites,
the Maan belonging to the latter.</p>

<p>The Shehab family, originally Hira Arabs, which had governed
Hauran under the early caliphs of Damascus, and thereafter
held power in Hermon, intermarried with the Maan; and in the
latter&rsquo;s day of weakness sided with the Kaisi faction and obtained
the supreme amirate of the Mountain. But it appears never to
have professed the Druse creed, remaining Sunnite. Haidar
Shehab, third of the line, inflicted a notable defeat on the pasha of
Saida (capital of an Ottoman eyalet since 1688) and the Yemenite
Druses at Ain Dara, near Zahleh, in 1711, and proceeded to
consolidate Shehab power, breaking up the old feudal society
and substituting for the sheikhs <i>mukatajis</i> (tax-contractors),
who had penal jurisdiction. The Yemenite Druses thereupon
emigrated in large numbers to the Hauran, and laid the foundation
of Druse power there. The Turks recognized the <i>status quo</i>,
and made terms with the Shehab amir in 1748; but his power
was none too well secured against the opposition of the Kurdish
<i>Jumblat</i> family, even though he was supported by the <i>Talhuk</i>,
<i>Abd al-Malik</i> and <i>Yezbeki</i> families; and it appears that some
members of the Shehab joined the Maronite faith in the middle
of the 18th century, causing a suspicion of secret apostasy to
fall on all the family.</p>

<p>It is said that the amir Beshir, who succeeded about 1786, was
himself a crypto-Christian. This remarkable man, who ruled
the Mountain for fifty-four years, maintained his power by taking
the side of one rebel pasha after another, betraying each in turn,
and cultivating relations with European admirals. His earliest
ally was Ahmed &ldquo;Jezzar,&rdquo; who established himself in Acre in
contumacious independence late in the 18th century. Beshir
supported Jezzar against Napoleon in 1799 and earned the
friendship of Sir Sidney Smith. Falling out with Jezzar, Beshir
fled to Cairo in 1805, attached himself to Mehemet Ali, and
returned to take up the reins. Once more chased out by the
Turks, he was again in the Mountain in 1823, allied with Abdallah,
on whom Jezzar&rsquo;s mantle had ultimately fallen at Acre, and
maintaining friendly relations with the &ldquo;English Princess,&rdquo;
Lady Hester Stanhope. He now finally worsted the Jumblat.
The invasion of Syria by Mehemet Ali in 1831 caused Beshir to
desert Abdallah and throw in his lot with Ibrahim Pasha; but
he was not cordially followed by the Druses in general, and had
good excuse for revolt in 1839, and intrigue with the British
admiral in 1840. Ibrahim, however, by his possession of Druse
hostages, restrained the amir, and after the bombardment of
Acre, the Turks called him to account for his record of rebellion
and treachery. He fled to Malta on a British ship, but was
induced to go to Constantinople, where he died in 1851.</p>

<p>His successor, Beshir al-Kassim, openly joined the Maronites,
and instigating these against the malcontents of his own people,
brought enmities, which had been growing for a century, to a
head, and initiated a devastating internecine warfare which was
to continue for twenty years. The state of the Lebanon went
from bad to worse, and at last, in January 1842, the Turkish
government appointed Omar Pasha as administrator of the
Druses and Maronites, with a council of four chiefs from each
party; but the pasha, attempting to effect a disarming, was
besieged in November in the castle of Beit ed-Din by the Druses
under Shibli el-Arrian. At the instigation of the European
powers he was recalled in December, and the Druses and Maronites
were placed under separate <i>kaimakams</i> (governors), who,
it was stipulated, were not to be of the family of Shehab. Disturbances
again broke out in 1845, the native <i>mukatajis</i> refusing
to obey the <i>kaimakams</i>. The Maronites flew to arms, but with
the assistance of the Turks their opponents carried the day.
A superficial pacification effected by Shekib Effendi, the Ottoman
commissioner, lasted only till his departure; and the Porte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page606" id="page606"></a>606</span>
was obliged to despatch a force of 12,000 men to the Lebanon.
Forty of the chiefs were seized, the people was nominally disarmed,
and in 1846 a new constitution was inaugurated, by
which the <i>kaimakam</i> was to be assisted by two Druses, two
Maronites, four Greeks, two Turks and one Metawali. All,
however, was in vain: the conflict was continued through 1858,
1859 and 1860; and the disturbance culminated in the famous
Damascus massacre (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Syria</a></span>). The European powers now
determined to interfere; and, by a protocol of the 3rd of May
1860, it was decided that the Lebanon should be occupied by a
force of 20,000 men, of whom half were to be French. A body
of troops was accordingly landed on the 16th of August under
General Beaufort d&rsquo;Hautpoul; and Fuad Pasha, who had been
appointed Turkish commissioner with full powers, proceeded
to bring the leaders of the massacres to justice. The French
occupation continued till the 5th of June 1861, and the French
and English squadrons cruised on the coast for several months
after. In accordance with the recommendation of the European
powers the Porte determined to appoint a Christian governor
not belonging to the district, and independent of the pasha of
Beirut, to hold office for three years. The choice fell on Daud
Pasha, an Armenian Catholic, who was installed on the 4th of
July. In spite of many difficulties, and especially the ambitious
conduct of the Maronite Jussuf Karam, he succeeded in restoring
order; and by the formation of a military force from the inhabitants
of the Lebanon he rendered unnecessary the presence
of the Turkish soldiery.</p>

<p>The privileged province of Lebanon (<i>q.v.</i>) was finally constituted
by the Organic Statute of the 6th of September 1864,
and the subsequent history of the Lebanon Druses is one of
gradual withdrawal from the jurisdiction of that state, in which
they see their ancient independence irretrievably compromised,
and their religion subordinated to Christian supremacy. Many
now emigrate, when occasion offers, to America.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Hauran, the old seat of the Shehab family
and Hermon Druses, had been steadily receiving a Druse influx,
since the day of Ain Dara (see above). Towards the close of the
18th century some 600 families left Lebanon for the Hauran,
in discontent with the rule of the Shehab dynasty, and their
place and property were taken by 1500 families driven out of
Jebel Ansarieh by Topal Ali in 1811. The Hauran Druses
increased by the middle of the 19th century to 7000 souls. They
had successfully resisted Ibrahim, the Egyptian, in 1839 in the
Lija, and asserted complete independence of the Turks, living
under a theocratic government directed by the chief Akil in
Suweda. A great effort, made by Kibrisli Pasha in 1852 to
subdue the Hauran, came to nothing. In 1879 the population
numbered 20,000, and by a murderous raid attracted the attention
of Midhat Pasha, then vali of the province of Syria. After
experiencing one disaster he defeated their forces and imposed a
<i>kaimakam</i>, at first drawn from the Talhuks, but subsequently
chosen from the Atrash family of Kunawat. But the Druses
still refused to pay taxes, to serve in the Ottoman army, or to
recognize the <i>kaimakam</i>, and maintained their contumacy under
the lead of the Jumblat, till 1896; when, as the result of a
military expedition under Tahir Pasha and a great defeat at
Ijun, a compromise was arrived at, under which the Druses
agreed to pay taxes, but to serve in their own territory only as a
frontier guard. The government was put into the hands of a
mutessarif resident at Sheikh Saad, under whom are <i>kaimakams</i>
at Suweda and Salkhad. Since that epoch there has been
comparative peace between the Druses and the government,
largely because the latter, having learned wisdom, leaves the
people very much to itself, maintaining only a small garrison of
regular troops, and enlisting Druse police for service in Jebel
Druz itself. The Druses are allowed to carry on their feuds
with the Bedouins of the E. Desert as they will, so long as they
do not disturb western districts. With the recent opening out
of the W. Hauran by railway, the Druse sheikhs are beginning
to acquire commercial ambitions, and to desire peace.</p>

<p>The Hauran Druses are a vigorous, independent folk, with a
well-deserved reputation for courage, very astute, and hospitable
to Europeans, especially the British, with whom they have an
old tradition of friendship. But, like most persecuted but semi-independent
peoples, they are both cruel, and, by our standards,
treacherous. They are a handsome race, the women being often
beautiful. The latter no longer carry the head-horn which used
to support the veil dropped over the face out of doors. But
their dress is still black with the exception of red slippers, and
the veil is never abandoned, not even, it is said, during sleep.
An English lady, who has been much among them, states that
the Druse women of the Hauran never unveiled before her.
The men wear a <i>tarbush</i> with white roll, a black under-robe
with white girdle, a short loose jacket, and when necessary an
<i>aba</i> or parti-coloured cloak over all. They go habitually armed
with scimitar and half-moon axe, besides gun or rifle.</p>

<p>Polygamy is forbidden. Marriage retains certain traces of
the original system of capture; but Druse women enjoy much
consideration, and are comparatively well educated, dignified
and free in their bearing in spite of their close veiling. As has
been stated above, they join the men in religious functions.
Divorce is easy and can be initiated by the woman; but remarriage
of the pair can only be effected by the good offices
of a proxy (as in Moslem societies, after a third divorce). Burial
takes place in family mausoleums, walled up after each interment;
but Akils are buried in their own houses. The body is laid on its
side, with its face to the south (Mecca).</p>

<p>Education is widely spread, and there is a considerable religious
literature, much of which is known in Europe. A copy of the
<i>Book of the Testimonies to the Mysteries of the Unity</i>, consisting
of seventy treatises in four folio volumes, was found in the
house of the chief Akil at Bakhlin, and presented in 1700 to
Louis XIV. by Nusralla ibn Gilda, a Syrian doctor. Other
manuscripts are to be found at Rome in the Vatican, at Oxford
in the Bodleian, at Vienna, at Leiden, at Upsala and at Munich;
and Dr J. L. Porter got possession of seven standard works of
Druse theology while at Damascus. The Munich collection was
presented to the king of Bavaria by Clot Bey, the chief physician
in the Egyptian army during its occupation of Syria; and for a
number of the other manuscripts we are indebted to the elder
Niebuhr. A history of the Druse nation by the amir Haidar
Shehab is quoted by Urquhart.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRUSIUS<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">van den Driesche</span>), <b>JOHANNES</b> (1550-1616),
Protestant divine, distinguished specially as an Orientalist and
exegete, was born at Oudenarde, in Flanders, on the 28th of June
1550. Being designed for the church, he studied Greek and
Latin at Ghent, and philosophy at Louvain; but his father
having been outlawed for his religion, and deprived of his estate,
retired to England, where the son followed him in 1567. He
found an admirable teacher of Hebrew in Chevalier, the celebrated
Orientalist, with whom he resided for some time at
Cambridge. In 1572 he became professor of Oriental languages
at Oxford. Upon the pacification of Ghent (1576) he returned
with his father to their own country, and was appointed professor
of Oriental languages at Leiden in the following year. In 1585
he removed to Friesland, and was admitted professor of Hebrew
in the university of Franeker, an office which he discharged with
great honour till his death, which happened in February 1616.
He acquired so extended a reputation as a professor that his
class was frequented by students from all the Protestant countries
in Europe. His works prove him to have been well skilled in
Hebrew and in Jewish antiquities; and in 1600 the states-general
employed him, at a salary of 400 florins a year, to write notes
on the most difficult passages in the Old Testament; but this
work was not published until after his death. As the friend of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page607" id="page607"></a>607</span>
Arminius, he was charged by the orthodox and dominant party
with unfairness in the execution of the task, and the last sixteen
years of his life were therefore somewhat embittered by controversy.
He carried on an extensive correspondence with the
learned in different countries; for, besides letters in Hebrew,
Greek and other languages, there were found amongst his papers
upwards of 2000 written in Latin. He had a son, John, who
died in England at the age of twenty-one, and was accounted
a prodigy of learning. He had mastered Hebrew at the age of
nine, and Scaliger said that he was a better Hebrew scholar than
his father. He wrote a large number of letters in Hebrew,
besides notes on the Proverbs of Solomon and other works.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Paquot states the number of the printed works and treatises of
the elder Drusius at forty-eight, and of the unprinted at upwards
of twenty. Of the former more than two-thirds were inserted in
the collection entitled <i>Critici sacri, sive annolata doctissimorum
virorum in Vetus et Novum Testamentum</i> (Amsterdam, 1698, in 9
vols. folio, or London, 1660, in 10 vols. folio). Amongst the works
of Drusius not to be found in this collection may be mentioned&mdash;(1)
<i>Alphabetum Hebraicum vetus</i> (1584, 4to); (2) <i>Tabulae in grammaticam
Chaldaicam ad usum juventutis</i> (1602, 8vo); (3) An edition

<p><span class="bold">DRUSUS, MARCUS LIVIUS,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> Roman statesman, was colleague
of Gaius Gracchus in the tribuneship, 122 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> The proposal
of Gracchus (<i>q.v.</i>) to confer the full franchise on the Latins had
been opposed not only by the senate, but also by the mob, who
imagined that their own privileges would thereby be diminished.
Drusus threatened to veto the proposal. Encouraged by this,
the senatorial party put up Drusus to outbid Gracchus. Gracchus
had proposed to found colonies outside Italy; Drusus provided
twelve in Italy, to each of which 3000 citizens were to be sent.
Gracchus had proposed to distribute allotments to the poorer
citizens subject to a state rent-charge; Drusus promised them
free of all charge, and further that they should be inalienable.
In addition to the franchise, immunity from corporal punishment
(even in the field) was promised the Latins. The absence of
Gracchus, and the inefficiency of his representative at Rome,
led to the acceptance of these proposals, which were never
intended to be carried. Drusus himself declined all responsibility
in connexion with carrying them out. He was rewarded
for his services by the consulship (112), and the title of <i>patronus
senatus</i>. He received Macedonia for his province, where he
distinguished himself in a campaign against the Scordisci, whom
he drove across the Danube, being the first Roman general who
reached that river. It is possible that he is the Drusus mentioned
by Plutarch as having died in 109, the year of his censorship.</p>

</div>

<p>His son, <span class="sc">Marcus Livius Drusus</span>, became tribune of the
people in 91 <span class="sc">b.c.</span> He was a thoroughgoing conservative, wealthy
and generous, and a man of high integrity. With some of the
more intelligent members of his party (such as Marcus Scaurus
and L. Licinius Crassus the orator) he recognized the need of
reform. At that time an agitation was going on for the transfer
of the judicial functions from the equites to the senate; Drusus
proposed as a compromise a measure which restored to the
senate the office of judices, while its numbers were doubled by
the admission of 300 equites. Further, a special commission
was to be appointed to try and sentence all judices guilty of
taking bribes. But the senate was lukewarm, and the equites,
whose occupation was threatened, offered the most violent
opposition. In order, therefore, to catch the popular votes,
Drusus proposed the establishment of colonies in Italy and
Sicily, and an increased distribution of corn at a reduced rate.
By help of these riders the bill was carried. Drusus now sought
a closer alliance with the Italians, promising them the long-coveted
boon of the Roman franchise. The senate broke out
into open opposition. His laws were abrogated as informal,
and each party armed its adherents for the civil struggle which
was now inevitable. Drusus was stabbed one evening as he was
returning home. His assassin was never discovered.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRUSUS, NERO<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> <a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> <span class="bold">CLAUDIUS</span> (38-9 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) Roman general,
son of Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla, stepson of
Augustus and younger brother of the emperor Tiberius. Having
held the office of quaestor and acted as praetor for his brother
during the latter&rsquo;s absence in Gaul, he began (in 15 <span class="sc">b.c.</span>) the
military career which has made his name famous. In conjunction
with Tiberius, he carried on a successful campaign against the
Raeti and Vindelici, who, although repulsed from Italy, continued
to threaten the frontiers of Gaul. The credit of the decisive
victory, however, must be assigned to Tiberius. Two of the
<i>Odes</i> of Horace (iv. 4 and 14) were written to glorify the exploits
of the brothers. In 13 Drusus was sent as governor to the
newly organized province of the three Gauls, where considerable
discontent had been aroused by the exactions of the Roman
governor Licinius. Drusus made a fresh assessment for taxation
purposes, and summoned the Gallic representatives to a meeting
at Lugdunum to discuss their grievances. It was of great
importance to pacify the Gauls, in order to have his hands free
to deal with the German tribes, one of which, the Sugambri,
on the right bank of the Rhine, had seized the opportunity,
during the absence of Augustus, to cross the river (12). Drusus
drove them back and pursued them through the island of the
Batavi and the land of the Usipetes (Usipes, Usipii) to their
own territory, which he devastated. Sailing down the Rhine,
he subdued the Frisii and, in order to facilitate operations against
the Chauci, dug a canal (Fossa Drusiana) leading from the
Rhenus (Rhine) to the Isala (Yssel)<a name="fa2g" id="fa2g" href="#ft2g"><span class="sp">2</span></a> into the lacus Flevus (Zuidersee)
and the German Ocean. Making his way along the Frisian
coast, he conquered the island of Burchanis (<i>Borkum</i>), defeated
the Bructeri in a naval engagement on the Amisia (<i>Ems</i>), and
went on to the mouth of the Visurgis (<i>Weser</i>) to attack the Chauci.
On the way back his vessels grounded on the shallows, and were
only got off with the assistance of the Frisii. Winter being close
at hand, the campaign was abandoned till the following spring,
and Drusus returned to Rome with the honour of having been
the first Roman general to reach the German Ocean.</p>

<p>In his second campaign (11), Drusus defeated the Usipetes,
threw a bridge over the Luppia (<i>Lippe</i>), attacked the Sugambri,
and advanced through their territory and that of the Tencteri and
Chatti as far as the Weser, where he gained a victory over the
Cherusci. Lack of provisions, the approach of winter, and an
inauspicious portent prevented him from crossing the Weser.
While making his way back to the Rhine he fell into an ambuscade,
but the carelessness of the enemy enabled him to inflict a
crushing defeat upon them. In view of future operations, he
built two castles, one at the junction of the Luppia and Aliso
(<i>Alme</i>), the other in the territory of the Chatti on the Taunus,
near Moguntiacum (<i>Mainz</i>).</p>

<p>The third campaign (10) was of little importance. The Chatti
had joined the Sugambri in revolt; and, after some insignificant
successes, Drusus returned with Augustus and Tiberius to Rome,
and was elected consul for the following year. In spite of
unfavourable portents at Rome, he determined to enter upon his
fourth and last campaign (9) without delay. He attacked and
defeated the Chatti, Suebi, Marcomanni and Cherusci, crossed
the Weser and penetrated as far as the Albis (<i>Elbe</i>). Here trophies
were set up to mark the farthest point ever reached by a Roman
army. Various measures were taken to secure the possession
of the conquered territory: fortresses were erected along the Elbe,
Weser and Maas (<i>Meuse</i>, <i>Mosa</i>); a flotilla was placed upon the
Rhine and a dam built upon the right arm of its estuary to increase
the flow of water into the canal mentioned above. Drusus
was said to have been deterred from crossing the Elbe by the
sudden appearance of a woman of supernatural size, who predicted
his approaching end. On his return, probably between
the Elbe and the Saale (<i>Sala</i>), his horse stumbled and threw him.
His leg was fractured and he died thirty days after the accident,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page608" id="page608"></a>608</span>
on the 14th of September. Suetonius mentions an absurd rumour
that he had been poisoned by order of Augustus, because he had
refused to obey the order for his recall. The body was carried to
the winter quarters of the army, whence it was escorted by
Tiberius to Rome, the procession being joined by Augustus at
Ticinum (Pavia). Tiberius delivered an oration over the remains
in the Forum, whence they were conveyed to the Campus
Martius and cremated, and ashes being deposited in the mausoleum
of Augustus.</p>

<p>Drusus was one of the most distinguished men of his time.
His agreeable manners, handsome person and brilliant military
talents gained him the affection of the troops, while his sympathy
with republican principles, endeared him to the people. It is
not too much to say that, had he and his son lived long enough,
they might have brought about the abolition of the monarchy.
Although the successes of Drusus, resulting in the subjection
of the German tribes from the Rhine to the Elbe, were too rapid
to be lasting, they brought home the fact of the existence of
the Romans to many who had never heard their name. For
his victories he received the title of Germanicus. He married
Antonia, the daughter of Marcus Antonius the triumvir, by whom
he had three children: Germanicus, adopted by Tiberius;
Claudius, afterwards emperor; and a daughter Livilla.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chief ancient authorities for the life of Drusus are Dio Cassius,
the epitomes of Livy, Suetonius (<i>Claudius</i>), Tacitus (portions of the
<i>Annals</i>), Florus (whose chief source is Livy), Velleius Paterculus, and
the <i>Consolatio ad Liviam</i>. The German campaigns were described
in the last books of Livy and the lost <i>Bella Germaniae</i> of the elder
Pliny. As would naturally be expected, they have produced an
extensive literature in Germany, J. Asbach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Die Feldzüge des
Nero Claudius Drusus&rdquo; (<i>Rhein. Jahrb.</i> lxxxv. 14-30) being especially
recommended; see also Mommsen&rsquo;s <i>History of the Roman

junior, to distinguish him from his uncle Nero Claudius Drusus,
was the only son of the emperor Tiberius by his first wife Vipsania
Agrippina. After having held several curule offices, he was
consul elect in <span class="sc">a.d.</span> 14, the year of Augustus&rsquo;s death. His father,
on his accession to the throne, immediately sent him to put down
a mutiny of the troops in Pannonia, a task which he successfully
accomplished (Tacitus, <i>Annals</i>, i. 24-30). As governor of Illyricum
(17), he set the Germanic tribes against one another, and
encouraged Catualda, chief of the Gothones, to drive out Marbod
(Maroboduus), king of the Marcomanni. On his return Drusus
was consul a second time (21) and in the following year received
the tribunician authority from Tiberius, which practically indicated
him as heir to the throne. Sejanus, who also aspired
to the supreme power, determined to remove Drusus. He
endeavoured to poison Tiberius&rsquo;s mind against him, seduced
Drusus&rsquo;s wife and persuaded her to assist him in murdering her
husband. Her physician Eudemus prepared and the eunuch
Lygdus administered a slow poison, from the effects of which
Drusus died after a lingering illness. Although Tiberius is said
to have received the news of his death with indifference, there is
no reason to suppose that he had any hand in it; indeed, he
seems to have entertained a genuine affection for his son. Drusus
was a man of violent passions, a drunkard and a debauchee,
but not entirely devoid of better feelings, as is shown by his
undoubtedly sincere grief at the death of Germanicus. The
cunning and reserve which he exhibited on occasion were probably
due to the instructions or influence of Tiberius (<i>Annals</i>,
iii. 8), since he was himself naturally frank and open, and for this
reason, notwithstanding his vices, more popular than his father.
He revelled in bloody gladiatorial displays, and the sharpest
swords used on such occasions were called &ldquo;Drusine.&rdquo;</p>

in 1748. By his uncle, Dr Lars Montin, to whom his education
was entrusted, he was sent to the university of Gothenburg,
whence he removed to Lund. After taking his degree there in
1776, he studied at Upsala under Linnaeus, and then became
for a time tutor to a young Swedish nobleman. He next visited
England, and, on the death of his friend Dr Daniel Charles
Solander (1736-1782), succeeded him as librarian to Sir Joseph
Banks. He was librarian to the Royal Society and also to the
Linnean Society. Of the latter, in 1788, he was one of the
founders, and, when it was incorporated by royal charter in 1802,
he took a leading part in drawing up its laws and regulations.
He was vice-president of the society till his death, which took
place in London on the 19th of October 1810. Besides papers
in the Transactions of the Linnean and other societies, Dryander
published <i>Dissertatio gradualis fungos regno vegetabili vindicans</i>
(Lund, 1776), and <i>Catalogus bibliothecae historico-naturalis
Josephi Banks, Bart.</i> (London, 1796-1800, 5 vols.). He also

<p><span class="bold">DRYBURGH ABBEY,<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> a monastic ruin in the extreme south-west
of Berwickshire, Scotland, about 5 m. S.E. of Melrose, and
1¼ m. E. of St Boswells station on the North British railway&rsquo;s
Waverley route from Edinburgh to Carlisle. The name has been
derived from the Gaelic <i>darach bruach</i>, &ldquo;oak bank,&rdquo; in allusion
to the fact that the Druids once practised their rites here. The
abbey occupies the spot where, about 522, St Modan, an Irish
Culdee, established a sanctuary&mdash;a secluded position on a tongue
of land washed on three sides by the Tweed. Founded in 1150
by David I.&mdash;though it has also been ascribed to Hugh de
Morville (d. 1162), lord of Lauderdale and constable of Scotland&mdash;it
enjoyed great prosperity until 1322, when it was partially
destroyed by the English under Edward II. It suffered again at
the hands of Richard II. in 1385, and was reduced to ruin during
the expedition of the earl of Hertford in 1545. After the Reformation
the estate was erected into a temporal lordship and given
(1604) by James VI. to John Erskine, 2nd earl of Mar. At a later
date it was sold, but reverted to a branch of the Erskines in
1786, when it was acquired by the 11th earl of Buchan. In 1700
the abbey lands belonged to Thomas Haliburton, Scott&rsquo;s great-grandfather,
and, but for an extravagant grand-uncle who became
bankrupt and had to part with the property, they would have
descended to Sir Walter by inheritance. &ldquo;We have nothing left
of Dryburgh,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but the right of stretching our bones
there.&rdquo; The style in general is Early English, but the west door
and the restored entrance from the nave to the cloisters are fine
examples of transitional Norman. Though in various stages of
decay, nearly every one of the monastic buildings is represented
by a fragment. Of the cruciform church&mdash;190 ft. long by 75
broad at the transepts&mdash;there remain some of the outer walls,
a segment of the choir, the east aisle of the north transept, the
stumps of some of the pillars of the nave, the west gable, the
south transept and its adjacent chapel of St Modan. The most
beautiful of these relics is St Mary&rsquo;s aisle of the north transept,
in which were buried Sir Walter Scott (1832), his wife, son, his
son-in-law John Gibson Lockhart, and his ancestors, the Haliburtons
of New Mains. Sir Walter&rsquo;s tomb is a plain block of
polished Peterhead granite, inscribed only with his name and the
dates of his birth and death. The next aisle is the burial-place
of the Erskines of Shielhill and the Haigs of Bemersyde. On
the south side of the church, at a lower level, stand the cloisters,
about 100 ft. square, bounded on the west by the dungeons,
on the south-west by the cellars and refectory, in the west wall
of which is an exquisite ivy-clad rose window, and on the east
by the chapter-house, on a still lower level. The chapter-house,
a lofty building with vaulted roof, is the most complete structure
of the group, and adjoining it on the south are, first the abbot&rsquo;s
parlour and then the library, the three apartments communicating
with each other, and constituting the oldest portion of the
abbey. In the grounds are many venerable trees, a yew near the
chapter-house being at least coeval with the abbey.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRYDEN, JOHN<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (1631-1700), English poet, born on or about
the 9th of August 1631, at Aldwinkle, in Northamptonshire,
was of Cumberland stock, though his family had been settled
for three generations in Northamptonshire, had acquired estates
and a baronetcy, and intermarried with landed families in that
county. His great-grandfather, who first carried the name south,
and acquired by marriage the estate of Canons Ashby, is said
to have known Erasmus, and to have been so proud of the great
scholar&rsquo;s friendship that he gave the name of Erasmus to his
eldest son. The name Erasmus was borne by the poet&rsquo;s father,
the third son of Sir Erasmus Dryden. The leanings and connexions
of the family were Puritan and anti-monarchical. Sir
Erasmus Dryden went to prison rather than pay loan money to
Charles I.; the poet&rsquo;s uncle, Sir John Dryden, and his father
Erasmus, served on government commissions during the Commonwealth.
His mother&rsquo;s family, the Pickerings, were still more
prominent on the Puritan side. Sir Gilbert Pickering, his cousin,
was chamberlain to the Protector, and was summoned to Cromwell&rsquo;s
House of Lords in 1657. A trustworthy tradition asserts
that John Dryden was born at the rectory of Aldwinkle All
Saints, of which his maternal grandfather, Henry Pickering,
was rector.</p>

<p>Dryden&rsquo;s education was such as became a scion of these
respectable families of squires and rectors, among whom the
chance contact with Erasmus had left a certain tradition of
scholarship. His father, whose own fortune, added to his wife&rsquo;s,
was not large, procured for the poet, who was the eldest of
fourteen children, admission to Westminster school as a king&rsquo;s
scholar, under the famous Dr Busby. Some elegiac verses which
Dryden wrote there on the death of a schoolfellow, Henry, Lord
Hastings, son of the earl of Huntingdon, in 1649, were published
in <i>Lacrymae Musarum</i>, among other elegies by &ldquo;divers persons
of nobility and worth&rdquo; in commemoration of the same event.
He appeared soon after again in print, among writers of commendatory
verses to a friend of his, John Hoddesdon, who
published a volume of <i>Epigrams</i> in 1650. Dryden&rsquo;s contribution
is signed &ldquo;John Dryden of Trinity C.,&rdquo; as he had gone up from
Westminster to Cambridge in May 1650. He was elected a
scholar of Trinity on the Westminster foundation in October of
the same year, and took his degree of B.A. in 1654. The only
recorded incident of his college residence is some unexplained
act of disobedience to the vice-master, for which he was &ldquo;put
out of commons&rdquo; and &ldquo;gated&rdquo; for a fortnight. His father died
in 1654, leaving him master of two-thirds of a small estate near
Blakesley, worth about £60 a year. The next three years he is
said to have spent at Cambridge. In any case they were spent
somewhere in study; for his first considerable poem bears
indisputable marks of scholarly habits, as well as of a command
of verse that could not have been acquired without practice.</p>

<p>The middle of 1657 is given as the date of his leaving the
university to take up his residence in London. In one of his
many subsequent literary quarrels, it was said by Shadwell that
he had been clerk to Sir Gilbert Pickering, his cousin, who was
chamberlain to Cromwell; and nothing is more likely than that
he obtained some employment under his powerful cousin when
he came to London. He is said to have lived at first in the house
of his first publisher, Herringman, with whom he was connected
till 1679, when Jacob Tonson began to publish his books. He
first emerged from obscurity with his <i>Heroic Stanzas</i> (1659) to the
memory of the Protector. That these stanzas should have made
him a name as a poet does not appear surprising when we compare
them with Waller&rsquo;s verses on the same occasion. Dryden took
some time to consider them, and it was impossible that they
should not give an impression of his intellectual strength. Donne
was his model; it is obvious that both his ear and his imagination
were saturated with Donne&rsquo;s elegiac strains when he wrote;
yet when we look beneath the surface we find unmistakable
traces that the pupil was not without decided theories that ran
counter to the practice of the master. It is plainly not by
accident that each stanza contains one clear-cut brilliant point.
The poem is an academic exercise, and it seems to be animated
by an under-current of strong contumacious protest against the
irregularities tolerated by the authorities. Dryden had studied
the ancient classics for himself, and their method of uniformity
and elaborate finish commended itself to his robust and orderly
mind. In itself the poem is a magnificent tribute to the memory
of Cromwell.</p>

<p>To those who regard the poet as a seer with a sacred mission,
and refuse the name altogether to a literary manufacturer to
order, it comes with a certain shock to find Dryden, the hereditary
Puritan, the panegyrist of Cromwell, hailing the return of King
Charles in <i>Astraea Redux</i> (1660), deploring his long absence,
and proclaiming the despair with which he had seen &ldquo;the rebel
thrive, the loyal crost.&rdquo; <i>A Panegyric on the Coronation</i> followed
in 1661. From a literary point of view also, <i>Astraea Redux</i> is
inferior to the <i>Heroic Stanzas</i>.</p>

<p>Dryden was compelled to supplement his slender income by
his writings. He naturally first thought of tragedy,&mdash;his own
genius, as he has informed us, inclining him rather to that species
of composition; and in the first year of the Restoration he wrote
a tragedy on the fate of Henry, duke of Guise. But some friends
advised him that its construction was not suited to the requirements
of the stage, so he put it aside, and used only one scene
of the original play later on, when he again attempted the subject
with a more practised hand. Having failed to write a suitable
tragedy, he next turned his attention to comedy, although, as
he admitted, he had little natural turn for it. &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo;
he said, in a short essay in his own defence, printed before <i>The
Indian Emperor</i>, &ldquo;my chief endeavours are to delight the age
in which I live. If the humour of this be for low comedy, small
accidents and raillery, I will force my genius to obey it, though
with more reputation I could write in verse. I know I am not
so fitted by nature to write comedy; I want that gaiety of
humour which is required to it. My conversation is slow and
dull; my humour saturnine and reserved; in short, I am none
of those who endeavour to break jests in company or make
repartees. So that those who decry my comedies do me no
injury, except it be in point of profit; reputation in them is the
last thing to which I shall pretend.&rdquo; He was really as well as
ostentatiously a playwright; the age demanded comedies, and
he endeavoured to supply the kind of comedy that the age
demanded. His first attempt was unsuccessful. Bustle, intrigue
and coarsely humorous dialogue seemed to him to be part of the
popular demand; and, looking about for a plot, he found something
to suit him in a Spanish source, and wrote <i>The Wild
Gallant</i>. The play was acted in February 1663, by Thomas
Killigrew&rsquo;s company in Vere Street. It was not a success, and
Pepys showed good judgment in pronouncing the play &ldquo;so
poor a thing as ever I saw in my life.&rdquo; Dryden never learned
moderation in his humour; there is a student&rsquo;s clumsiness and
extravagance in his indecency; the plays of Etheredge, a man
of the world, have not the uncouth riotousness of Dryden&rsquo;s.
Of this he seems to have been conscious, for when the play was
revived, in 1667, he complained in the epilogue of the difficulty
of comic wit, and admitted the right of a common audience to
judge of the wit&rsquo;s success. Dryden, indeed, took a lesson from
the failure of <i>The Wild Gallant</i>; his next comedy, <i>The Rival
Ladies</i>, also founded on a Spanish plot, produced before the end
of 1663, and printed in the next year, was correctly described by
Pepys as &ldquo;a very innocent and most pretty witty play,&rdquo; though
there was much in it which the taste of our time would consider
indelicate. But he never quite conquered his tendency to
extravagance. <i>The Wild Gallant</i> was not the only victim. <i>The
Assignation, or Love in a Nunnery</i>, produced in 1673, shared
the same fate; and even as late as 1680, when he had had twenty
years&rsquo; experience to guide him, <i>The Kind Keeper, or Mr Limberham</i>
was prohibited, after three representations, as being too
indecent for the stage. Dislike to indecency we are apt to think
a somewhat ludicrous pretext to be made by Restoration playgoers,
and probably there was some other reason for the sacrifice
of <i>Limberham</i>; still there is a certain savageness in the spirit
of Dryden&rsquo;s indecency which we do not find in his most licentious
contemporaries. The undisciplined force of the man carried
him to an excess from which more dexterous writers held back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page610" id="page610"></a>610</span></p>

<p>After the production of <i>The Rival Ladies</i> in 1663, Dryden
assisted Sir Robert Howard in the composition of a tragedy in
heroic verse, <i>The Indian Queen</i>, produced with great splendour
in January 1664. He married Lady Elizabeth Howard, Sir
Robert&rsquo;s sister and daughter of the 1st earl of Berkshire, on the
1st of December 1663. Lady Elizabeth&rsquo;s reputation was somewhat
compromised before this union, which was not a happy one,
and there is some evidence for the scandal in a letter written by
her before her marriage to Philip, 2nd earl of Chesterfield. <i>The
Indian Queen</i> was a great success, one of the greatest since the
reopening of the theatres. This was in all likelihood due much
less to the heroic verse and the exclusion of comic scenes from
the tragedy than to the magnificent scenic accessories&mdash;the
battles and sacrifices on the stage, the spirits singing in the air,
and the god of dreams ascending through a trap. The novelty
of these Indian spectacles, as well as of the Indian characters,
with the splendid Queen Zempoalla, acted by Mrs Marshall in
a real Indian dress of feathers presented to her by Mrs Aphra
Behn, as the centre of the play, was the chief secret of the success
of <i>The Indian Queen</i>. These melodramatic properties were so
marked a novelty that they could not fail to draw the town.
Dryden was tempted to return to tragedy; he followed up
<i>The Indian Queen</i> with <i>The Indian Emperor, or the Conquest of
Mexico by the Spaniards</i>, which was acted in 1665, and also proved
a success.</p>

<p>But Dryden was not content with writing tragedies in rhymed
verse. He took up the question of the propriety of rhyme in
serious plays immediately after the success of <i>The Indian Queen</i>,
in the preface to an edition (1664) of <i>The Rival Ladies</i>. In that
first statement of his case, he considered the chief objection to
the use of rhyme, and urged his chief argument in its favour.
Rhyme was not natural, some people had said; to which he
answers that it is as natural as blank verse, and that much of
its unnaturalness is not the fault of the rhyme but of the writer,
who has not sufficient command of language to rhyme easily.
In favour of rhyme he has to say that it at once stimulates the
imagination, and prevents it from being too discursive in its
flights.</p>

<p>During the Great Plague, when the theatres were closed, and
Dryden was living at Charlton, Wiltshire, at the seat of his
father-in-law, the earl of Berkshire, he occupied a considerable
part of his time in thinking over the principles of dramatic composition,
and threw his conclusions into the form of a dialogue,
which he called an <i>Essay of Dramatick Poesie</i> and published in
1668. The essay takes the form of a dialogue between Neander
(Dryden), Eugenius (Charles, Lord Buckhurst, afterwards earl
of Dorset), Crites (Sir R. Howard), and Lisideius (Sir C. Sedley),
who is made responsible for the famous definition of a play as a
&ldquo;just and lively image of human nature, representing its passions
and humours, and the changes of fortune to which it is subject,
for the delight and instruction of mankind.&rdquo; Dryden&rsquo;s form
is of course borrowed from the ancients, and his main source
is the critical work of Corneille in the prefaces and discourses
contained in the edition of 1660, but he was well acquainted
with the whole body of contemporary French and Spanish
criticism. Crites maintains the superiority of the classical
drama; Lisideius supports the exacting rules of French dramatic
writing; Neander defends the English drama of the preceding
generations, including, in a long speech, an examination of
Ben Jonson&rsquo;s <i>Silent Woman</i>. Neander argues, however, that
English drama has much to gain by the observance of exact
methods of construction without abandoning entirely the liberty
which English writers had always claimed. He then goes on to
defend the use of rhyme in serious drama. Howard had argued
against the use of rhyme in a &ldquo;preface&rdquo; to <i>Four New Plays</i>
(1665), which had furnished the excuse for Dryden&rsquo;s essay.
Howard replied to Dryden&rsquo;s essay in a preface to <i>The Duke of
Lerma</i> (1668). Dryden at once replied in a masterpiece of
sarcastic retort and vigorous reasoning, <i>A Defence of an Essay of
Dramatique Poesie</i>, prefixed to the second edition (1668) of <i>The
Indian Emperor</i>. It is the ablest and most complete statement of
his views about the employment of rhymed couplets in tragedy.</p>

<p>Before his return to town at the end of 1666, when the theatres
(which had been closed during the disasters of 1665 and 1666)
were reopened, Dryden wrote a poem on the Dutch war and the
Great Fire entitled <i>Annus Mirabilis</i>. The poem is in quatrains,
the metre of his <i>Heroic Stanzas</i> in praise of Cromwell, which
Dryden chose, he tells us, &ldquo;because he had ever judged it more
noble and of greater dignity both for the sound and number
than any other verse in use amongst us.&rdquo; The preface to the
poem contains an interesting discussion of what he calls &ldquo;wit-writing,&rdquo;
introduced by the remark that &ldquo;the composition of all
poems is or ought to be of wit.&rdquo; His description of the Great
Fire is a famous specimen of this wit-writing, much more
careless and daring, and much more difficult to sympathize
with, than the graver conceits in his panegyric of the Protector.
In <i>Annus Mirabilis</i> the poet apostrophizes the newly
founded Royal Society, of which he had been elected a member
in 1662.</p>

<p>From the reopening of the theatres in 1666 till November
1681, the date of his <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, Dryden produced
nothing but plays. The stage was his chief source of income.
<i>Secret Love, or the Maiden Queen</i>, a tragi-comedy, produced in
March 1667, was based on an episode in the <i>Artamène, ou le
Grand Cyrus</i> of Mlle de Scudéry, the historical original of the
&ldquo;Maiden Queen&rdquo; being Christina, queen of Sweden. The prologue
claims that the piece is written with pains and thought,
by the exactest rules, with strict observance of the unities,
and &ldquo;a mingled chime of Jonson&rsquo;s humour and of Corneille&rsquo;s
rhyme&rdquo;; but it owed its success chiefly to the charm of Nell
Gwyn&rsquo;s acting in the part of Florimel. It is noticeable that
only the more passionate parts of the dialogue are rhymed,
Dryden&rsquo;s theory apparently being that rhyme is then demanded
for the elevation of the style. His next play, <i>Sir Martin Mar-all,
or the Feigned Innocence</i>, an adaptation in prose of the duke
of Newcastle&rsquo;s translation of Molière&rsquo;s <i>L&rsquo;Étourdi</i>, was produced
at the Duke&rsquo;s theatre, without the author&rsquo;s name, in 1667. It
was about this time that Dryden became a retained writer
under contract for the King&rsquo;s theatre, receiving from it £300
or £400 a year, till it was burnt down in 1672, and about £200
for six years more till the beginning of 1678. His co-operation
with Davenant in a new version (1667) of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Tempest</i>&mdash;for
his share in which Dryden can hardly be pardoned on the
ground that the chief alterations were happy thoughts of Davenant&rsquo;s,
seeing that he affirms he never worked at anything with
more delight&mdash;must also be supposed to be anterior to the
completion of his contract with the Theatre Royal. He was
engaged to write three plays a year, and he contributed only
ten plays during the ten years of his engagement, finally exhausting
the patience of his partners by joining in the composition
of a play for the rival house. In adapting <i>L&rsquo;Étourdi</i>,
Dryden did not catch Molière&rsquo;s lightness of touch; his alterations
go towards making the comedy into a farce. Perhaps all the
more on this account <i>Sir Martin Mar-all</i> had a great run at
the theatre in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields. There is always a certain
coarseness in Dryden&rsquo;s humour, apart from the coarseness of
his age,&mdash;a certain forcible roughness of touch which belongs
to the character of the man. His <i>An Evening&rsquo;s Love, or the Mock
Astrologer</i>, an adaptation from <i>Le Feint Astrologue</i> of the younger
Corneille, produced at the King&rsquo;s theatre in 1668, seemed to
Pepys &ldquo;very smutty, and nothing so good as <i>The Maiden Queen</i>
or <i>The Indian Emperor</i> of Dryden&rsquo;s making.&rdquo; Evelyn thought
it foolish and profane, and was grieved &ldquo;to see how the stage
was degenerated and polluted by the licentious times.&rdquo; <i>Ladies
à la Mode</i>, another of Dryden&rsquo;s contract comedies, produced in
1668, was &ldquo;so mean a thing,&rdquo; Pepys says, that it was only once
acted, and Dryden never published it. Of his other comedies,
<i>Marriage à la Mode</i> (produced 1672), <i>The Assignation, or Love
in a Nunnery</i> (1673), <i>The Kind Keeper, or Mr Limberham</i> (1678),
only the first was moderately successful.</p>

<p>While Dryden met with such indifferent success in his willing
efforts to supply the demand of the age for low comedy, he
struck upon a really popular and profitable vein in heroic
tragedy. <i>Tyrannic Love, or the Royal Martyr</i>, a Roman play
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page611" id="page611"></a>611</span>
dealing with the persecution of the Christians by Maximin, in
which St Catherine is introduced, and with her some supernatural
machinery, was produced in 1669. It is in rhymed couplets,
but the author again did not trust solely for success to them;
for, besides the magic incantations, the singing angels, and the
view of Paradise, he made Nell Gwyn, who had stabbed herself
as Valeria, start to life again as she was being carried off the
stage, and speak a riotous epilogue, in violent contrast to the
serious character of the play. <i>Almanzor and Almahide, or the
Conquest of Granada</i>, a tragedy in two parts, was written in 1669
to 1670. The historical background is taken chiefly from Mlle de
Scudéry&rsquo;s romance of <i>Almahide</i>, but Dryden borrows freely from
other books of hers and her contemporaries. This piece seems
to have given the crowning touch of provocation to the wits,
who had never ceased to ridicule the popular taste for these
extravagant heroic plays. Dryden almost invited burlesque
in his epilogue to the second part of <i>The Conquest of Granada</i>,
in which he charged the comedy of the Elizabethan age with
coarseness and mechanical humour, and its conceptions of
love and honour with meanness, and claimed for his own time
and his own plays an advance in these respects. <i>The Rehearsal</i>,
written by the duke of Buckingham, with the assistance, it
was said, of Samuel Butler, Martin Clifford, Thomas Sprat and
others, and produced in 1671, was a severe and just punishment
for this boast. Davenant was originally the hero, but on his
death in 1668 the satire was turned upon Dryden, who is here
unmercifully ridiculed under the name of Bayes, the name being
justified by his appointment in 1670 as poet laureate and historiographer
to the king (with a pension of £300 a year and a butt
of canary wine). It is said that <i>The Rehearsal</i> was begun in
1663 and ready for representation before the plague. But this
probably only means that Buckingham and his friends had
resolved to burlesque the absurdities of Davenant&rsquo;s operatic
heroes in <i>The Siege of Rhodes</i>, and the extravagant heroics of
<i>The Indian Queen</i>. Materials accumulated upon them as the
fashion continued, and by the time Dryden had produced his
<i>Tyrannic Love</i>, and his <i>Conquest of Granada</i>, he had so established
himself as the chief offender as to become naturally the central
figure of the burlesque. Later Dryden fully avenged himself
on Buckingham by his portrait of Zimri in <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>.
His immediate reply is contained in the preface &ldquo;Of
Heroic Plays&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Defence of the Epilogue,&rdquo; printed in
the first edition (1672) of his <i>Conquest of Granada</i>. In these, so
far from laughing with his censors, he addresses them from the
eminence of success. &ldquo;But I have already swept the stakes;
and, with the common good fortune of prosperous gamesters,
can be content to sit quietly; to hear my fortune cursed by some,
and my faults arraigned by others, and to suffer both without
reply.&rdquo; Heroic verse, he assures them, is so established that few
tragedies are likely henceforward to be written in any other
metre. In the course of a year or two <i>The Conquest of Granada</i>
was attacked also by Elkanah Settle, on whom Dryden revenged
himself later, making him the &ldquo;Doeg&rdquo; of the second part of
<i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>.</p>

<p>His next tragedy, <i>Amboyna</i> (1673), an exhibition of certain
atrocities committed by the Dutch on English merchants in
the East Indies, put on the stage to inflame the public mind in
view of the Dutch war, was written, with the exception of a few
passages, in prose, and those passages in blank verse. An opera
which he wrote in rhymed couplets, called <i>The State of Innocence,
and Fall of Man</i>, an attempt to turn part of <i>Paradise Lost</i> into
rhyme, as a proof of its superiority to blank verse, was prefaced
by an &ldquo;Apology for Heroique Poetry and Poetique Licence,&rdquo;
and entered at Stationers&rsquo; Hall in 1674, but it was never acted.
The redeeming circumstance about the performance is the
admiration professed by the adapter for his original, which he
pronounces &ldquo;undoubtedly one of the greatest, most noble and
most sublime poems which either this age or nation has produced.&rdquo;
Dryden is said to have had the elder poet&rsquo;s leave &ldquo;to
tag his verses.&rdquo; In <i>Aurengzebe</i>, which was Dryden&rsquo;s last, and
also his best, rhymed tragedy, he borrowed from contemporary
history, for the Great Mogul was still living. In the prologue
he confessed that he had grown weary of his long-loved mistress
rhyme and retracted, with characteristic frankness, his disparaging
contrast of the Elizabethan with his own age. But the stings
of <i>The Rehearsal</i> had stimulated him to do his utmost to justify
his devotion to his mistress, and he claims that <i>Aurengzebe</i> is
&ldquo;the most correct&rdquo; of his plays. It was entered at Stationers&rsquo;
Hall and probably acted in 1675, and published in the following
year.</p>

<p>After the production of <i>Aurengzebe</i> he seems to have rested
for an interval from writing, enabled to do so, probably by an
additional pension of £100 granted to him by the king. During
this interval he would seem to have reconsidered the principles
of dramatic composition, and to have made a particular study of
the works of Shakespeare. The fruits of this appeared in <i>All
for Love, or the World Well Lost</i>, a version of the story of Antony
and Cleopatra, produced in 1678, which must be regarded as
a very remarkable departure for a man of his age, and a wonderful
proof of undiminished openness and plasticity of mind. In his
previous writings on dramatic theory, Dryden, while admiring
the rhyme of the French dramatists as an advance in art, did
not give unqualified praise to the regularity of their plots; he
was disposed to allow the irregular structure of the Elizabethan
dramatists, as being more favourable to variety both of action
and of character. But now, in frank imitation of Shakespeare,
he abandoned rhyme, and, if we might judge from <i>All for Love</i>,
and the precepts laid down in his &ldquo;Grounds of Criticism in
Tragedy,&rdquo; prefixed to <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> (1679), the chief
point in which he aimed at excelling the Elizabethans was in
giving greater unity to his plot. He upheld still the superiority
of Shakespeare to the French dramatists in the delineation of
character, but he thought that the scope of the action might be
restricted, and the parts bound more closely together with
advantage. <i>All for Love</i> and <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> are two
excellent plays for the comparison of the two methods. Dryden
gave all his strength to <i>All for Love</i>, writing the play for himself,
as he said, and not for the public. Carrying out the idea expressed
in the title, he represents the two lovers as being more
entirely under the dominion of love than Shakespeare&rsquo;s Antony
and Cleopatra. Shakespeare&rsquo;s Antony is moved by other impulses
than the passion for Cleopatra; it is his master motive,
but it has to maintain a struggle for supremacy; &ldquo;Roman
thoughts&rdquo; strike in upon him even in the very height of the
enjoyment of his mistress&rsquo;s love, he chafes under the yoke, and
breaks away from her of his own impulse at the call of spontaneously
reawakened ambition. Dryden&rsquo;s Antony is so deeply sunk
in love that no other impulse has power to stir him; it takes
much persuasion and skilful artifice to detach him from Cleopatra
even in thought, and his soul returns to her violently before the
rupture has been completed. On the other hand, Dryden&rsquo;s
Cleopatra is so completely enslaved by love for Antony that she
is incapable of using the calculated caprices and meretricious
coquetries which Shakespeare&rsquo;s Cleopatra deliberately practises
as the highest art of love, the surest way of maintaining her
empire over her great captain&rsquo;s heart. It is with difficulty that
Dryden&rsquo;s Cleopatra will agree, on the earnest solicitation of a
wily counsellor, to feign a liking for Dolabella to excite Antony&rsquo;s
jealousy, and she cannot keep up the pretence through a few
sentences. The characters of the two lovers are thus very much
contracted, indeed almost overwhelmed, beneath the pressure of
the one ruling motive. And as Dryden thus introduces a greater
regularity of character into the drama, so he also very much
contracts the action, in order to give probability to this temporary
subjugation of individual character. The action of Dryden&rsquo;s
play takes place wholly in Alexandria, within the compass of
a few days; it does not, like Shakespeare&rsquo;s, extend over several
years, and present incessant changes of scene. Dryden chooses,
as it were, a fragment of a historical action, a single moment
during which motives play within a narrow circle, the culminating
point in the relations between his two personages. He devotes
his whole play, also, to those relations; only what bears upon
them is admitted. In Shakespeare&rsquo;s play we get a certain
historical perspective, in which the love of Antony and Cleopatra
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page612" id="page612"></a>612</span>
appears in its true proportions beneath the firmament that
overhangs human affairs. In Dryden&rsquo;s play this love is our
universe; all the other concerns of the world retire into a
shadowy, indistinct background. If we rise from a comparison
of the plays with an impression that the Elizabethan drama is a
higher type of drama, taking Dryden&rsquo;s own definition of the
word as &ldquo;a just and lively image of human nature,&rdquo; we rise also
with an impression of Dryden&rsquo;s power such as we get from
nothing else that he had written since his <i>Heroic Stanzas</i>, twenty
years before.</p>

<p>It was twelve years before Dryden produced another tragedy
worthy of the power shown in <i>All for Love</i>. <i>Don Sebastian</i> was
acted and published in 1690. In the interval, to sum up briefly
Dryden&rsquo;s work as a dramatist, he wrote <i>Oedipus</i> (pr. 1679) and
<i>The Duke of Guise</i> (pr. 1683) in conjunction with Nathaniel Lee;
<i>Troilus and Cressida</i> (1679); <i>The Spanish Friar</i> (1681); <i>Albion
and Albanius</i>, an opera (1685); <i>Amphitryon</i> (1690). In <i>Troilus
and Cressida</i> he follows Shakespeare closely in the plot, but the
dialogue is rewritten throughout, and not for the better. The
versification and the language of the first and the third acts of
<i>Oedipus</i>, which with the general plan of the play were Dryden&rsquo;s
contribution to the joint work, bear marked evidence of his
recent study of Shakespeare. The <i>Duke of Guise</i> provided an
obvious parallel with contemporary English politics. Henry III.
was identified with Charles II., and Monmouth with the duke.
The lord chamberlain refused to license it until the political
situation was less disturbed. The plot of <i>Don Sebastian</i> is more
intricate than that of <i>All for Love</i>. It has also more of the
characteristics of his heroic dramas; the extravagance of
sentiment and the suddenness of impulse remind us occasionally
of <i>The Indian Emperor</i>; but the characters are much more
elaborately studied than in Dryden&rsquo;s earlier plays, and the verse
is sinewy and powerful. It would be difficult to say whether <i>Don
Sebastian</i> or <i>All for Love</i> is his best play; they share the palm
between them. Dryden&rsquo;s subsequent plays are not remarkable.
Their titles and dates are&mdash;<i>King Arthur</i>, an opera (1691), for
which Purcell wrote the music; <i>Cleomenes</i> (1692); <i>Love
Triumphant</i> (1694).</p>

<p>Soon after Dryden&rsquo;s abandonment of heroic couplets in tragedy,
he found new and more congenial work for his favourite instrument
in satire. As usual the idea was not original to Dryden,
though he struck in with his majestic step and energy divine,
and immediately took the lead. The pioneer was Mulgrave in
his <i>Essay on Satire</i>, an attack on Rochester and the court,
which was circulated in MS. in 1679. Dryden himself was
suspected of the authorship, and it is not impossible that he gave
some help in revising it; but it is not likely that he attacked
the king on whom he was dependent for the greater part of his
income, and Mulgrave in a note to his <i>Art of Poetry</i> in 1717
expressly asserts Dryden&rsquo;s ignorance. Dryden, however, was
attacked in Rose Street, Covent Garden, and severely cudgelled
by a company of ruffians who were generally supposed to have
been hired by Rochester. In the same year Oldham&rsquo;s satire on
the Jesuits had immense popularity, chiefly owing to the excitement
about the Popish plot. Dryden took the field as a satirist
towards the close of 1681, on the side of the court, at the moment
when Shaftesbury, baffled in his efforts to exclude the duke of
York from the throne as a papist, and secure the succession of
the duke of Monmouth, was waiting his trial for high treason.
<i>Absalom and Achitophel</i> produced a great stir. Nine editions
were sold in rapid succession in the course of a year. There was
no compunction in Dryden&rsquo;s ridicule and invective. Delicate
wit was not one of Dryden&rsquo;s gifts; the motions of his weapon
were sweeping, and the blows hard and trenchant. The advantage
he had gained by his recent studies of character was fully
used in his portraits of Shaftesbury and Buckingham, Achitophel
and Zimri. In these portraits he shows considerable art in the
introduction of redeeming traits to the general outline of
malignity and depravity. It is not impossible that the fact
that his pension had not been paid since the beginning of 1680
weighed with him in writing this satire to gain the favour of the
court. In a play produced in 1681, <i>The Spanish Friar</i>, he had
written on the other side, gratifying the popular feeling by
attacking the Roman Catholic priesthood.</p>

<p>Three other satires followed <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, one of
them hardly inferior in point of literary power. <i>The Medall</i>; a
<i>Satyre against Sedition</i> (March 1682) was written in ridicule of
the medal struck to commemorate Shaftesbury&rsquo;s acquittal.
Then Dryden had to take vengeance on the literary champions
of the Whig party who had opened upon him with all their
artillery. Their leader, Shadwell, had attacked him in <i>The
Medal of John Bayes</i>, which Dryden answered in October 1682
by <i>Mac Flecknoe, or a Satyr upon the True-Blew Protestant Poet,
T.S.</i> This satire, in which Shadwell filled the title-rôle, served
as the model of the <i>Dunciad</i>. To the second part of <i>Absalom
and Achitophel</i> (November 1682), written chiefly by Nahum Tate,
he contributed a long passage of invective against Robert
Ferguson, one of Monmouth&rsquo;s chief advisers, Elkanah Settle,
Shadwell and others. <i>Religio Laici</i>, which appeared in the same
month, though nominally an exposition of a layman&rsquo;s creed,
and deservedly admired as such, was not without a political
purpose. It attacked the Papists, but declared the &ldquo;fanatics&rdquo;
to be still more dangerous.</p>

<p>Dryden&rsquo;s next poem in heroic couplets was in a different strain.
On the accession of James, in 1685, he became a Roman Catholic.
There has been much discussion as to whether this conversion
was or was not sincere. It can only be said that the coincidence
between his change of faith and his change of patron was suspicious,
and that Dryden&rsquo;s character for consistency is certainly
not of a kind to quench suspicion. The force of the coincidence
cannot be removed by such pleas as that his wife had been a
Roman Catholic for several years, or that he was converted by
his son, who was converted at Cambridge, even if there were
any evidence for these statements. Scott defended Dryden&rsquo;s conversion,&mdash;as
Macaulay denounced it, from party motives. It is
worth while, however, to notice that in his earlier defence of the
English Church he exhibits a desire for the definite guidance of a
presumably infallible creed, and the case for the Roman Church
brought forward at the time may have appeared convincing to a
mind singularly open to new impressions. At the same time
nothing can be clearer than that Dryden always regarded his
literary powers as a means of subsistence, and had little scruple
about accepting a brief on any side. <i>The Hind and the Panther</i>,
published in 1687, is an ingenious argument for Roman Catholicism,
put into the mouth of &ldquo;a milk-white hind, immortal and
unchanged.&rdquo; There is considerable beauty in the picture of this
tender creature, and its enemies in the forest are not spared.
One can understand the admiration that the poem received
when such allegories were in fashion. It was the chief cause
of the veneration with which Dryden was regarded by Pope,
who, himself educated in the Roman Catholic faith, was taken
as a boy of twelve to see the veteran poet in his chair of honour
and authority at Wills&rsquo;s coffee-house. It was also very open to
ridicule, and was treated in this spirit by Prior and Montagu, the
future earl of Halifax, in <i>The Hind and the Panther transversed
to the story of the Country Mouse and the City Mouse</i>. Dryden&rsquo;s
other literary services to James were a savage reply to Stillingfleet&mdash;who
had attacked two papers published by the king
immediately after his accession, one said to have been written
by his late brother in advocacy of the Church of Rome, the
other by his late wife explaining the reasons for her conversion&mdash;and
a translation of a life of Xavier in prose. He had written
also a panegyric of Charles, <i>Threnodia Augustalis</i>, and a poem
in honour of the birth of James II.&rsquo;s heir, under the title of
<i>Britannia rediviva</i> (1688).</p>

<p>Dryden did not abjure his new faith on the Revolution, and
so lost his office and pension as laureate and historiographer
royal. For this act of constancy he deserves credit, if the new
powers would have considered his services worth having after
his frequent apostasies. His rival Shadwell reigned in his stead.
Dryden was once more thrown mainly upon his pen for support.
He turned again to the stage and wrote the plays already enumerated.
A great feature in the last decade of his life was his
translations from the classics. <i>Ovid&rsquo;s Epistles translated</i> appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page613" id="page613"></a>613</span>
in 1680; and numerous translations from Virgil, Horace,
Ovid, Lucretius and Theocritus appeared in the four volumes
of <i>Miscellany Poems</i>&mdash;<i>Miscellany Poems</i> (1684), <i>Sylvae</i> (1685),
<i>Examen poeticum</i> (1693), <i>The Annual Miscellany</i> (1694 by the
&ldquo;most eminent hands&rdquo;); in 1693 was published the verse
translation of the <i>Satires</i> of Juvenal and of Persius by &ldquo;Mr
Dryden and several other eminent hands,&rdquo; which contained his
&ldquo;Discourse concerning the Original and Progress of Satire&rdquo;;
and in 1697 Jacob Tonson published his most important translation,
<i>The Works of Virgil</i>.  The book, which was the result of
three years&rsquo; labour, was a vigorous, rather than a close, rendering
of Virgil into the style of Dryden. Among other notable poems
of this period are the two &ldquo;Songs for St Cecilia&rsquo;s Day,&rdquo; written
for a London musical society for 1687 and 1697, and published
separately. The second of these is the famous ode on &ldquo;Alexander&rsquo;s
Feast.&rdquo; The well-known paraphrase of <i>Veni, Creator
Spiritus</i> was posthumously printed, and his &ldquo;Ode to the memory
of Anne Killigrew,&rdquo; called by Dr Johnson the noblest ode in the
language, was written in 1686.</p>

<p>His next work was to render some of Chaucer&rsquo;s and Boccaccio&rsquo;s
tales and Ovid&rsquo;s <i>Metamorphoses</i> into his own verse. These translations
appeared in November 1699, a few months before his
death, and are known by the title of <i>Fables, Ancient and Modern</i>.
The preface, which is an admirable example of Dryden&rsquo;s prose,
contains an excellent appreciation of Chaucer, and, incidentally,
an answer to Jeremy Collier&rsquo;s attack on the stage. Thus
a large portion of the closing years of Dryden&rsquo;s life was spent
in translating for bread. He had a windfall of 500 guineas from
Lord Abingdon for a poem on the death of his wife in 1691,
and he received liberal presents from his cousin John Driden
and from the duke of Ormonde, but generally he was in considerable
pecuniary straits. Besides, his three sons held various
posts in the service of the pope at Rome, and he could not
well be on good terms with both courts. However, he was not
molested in London by the government, and in private he was
treated with the respect due to his old age and his admitted
position as the greatest of living English poets. He held a small
court at Wills&rsquo;s coffee-house, where he spent his evenings;
here he had a chair by the fire in winter and by the window in
summer; Congreve, Vanbrugh and Addison were among his
admirers, and here Pope saw the old poet of whom he was to be
the most brilliant disciple. He died at his house in Gerrard
Street, London, on the 1st of May 1700 and was buried on the
13th of the month in Westminster Abbey. Dryden&rsquo;s portrait,
by Sir G. Kneller, is in the National Portrait Gallery.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DRY ROT,<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> a fungoid disease in timber which occasions the
destruction of its fibres, and reduces it eventually to a mass of dry
dust. It is produced most readily in a warm, moist, stagnant
atmosphere, while common or wet rot is the result of the exposure
of wood to repeated changes of climatic conditions. The most
formidable of the dry rot fungi is the species <i>Merulius lacrymans</i>,
which is particularly destructive of coniferous wood; other
species are <i>Polyporus hybridus</i>, which thrives in oak-built ships,
and <i>P. destructor</i> and <i>Thelephora puteana</i>, found in a variety of
wooden structures.</p>

<p>The felling of trees when void of fresh sap, as a means of obviating
the rotting of timber, is a practice of very ancient origin.
Vitruvius directs (ii. cap. 9) that, to secure good timber, trees
should be cut to the pith, so as to allow of the escape of their
sap, which by dying in the wood would injure its quality; also
that felling should take place only from early autumn until the
end of winter. The supposed superior quality of wood cut in
winter, and the early practice in England of felling oak timber at
that season, may be inferred from a statute of James I., which
enacted &ldquo;that no person or persons shall fell, or cause to be felled,
any oaken trees meet to be barked, when bark is worth 2s. a cart-load
(timber for the needful building and reparation of houses,
ships or mills only excepted), but between the first day of April
and last day of June, not even for the king&rsquo;s use, out of barking
time, except for building or repairing his Majesty&rsquo;s houses or
ships.&rdquo; In giving testimony before a committee of the House
of Commons in March 1771, Mr Barnard of Deptford expressed
it as his opinion that to secure durable timber for shipbuilding,
trees should be barked in spring and not felled till the succeeding
winter. In France, so long ago as 1669, a royal decree limited
the felling of timber from the 1st of October to the 15th of April;
and, in an order issued to the commissioners of forests, Napoleon
I. directed that the felling of naval timber should take place only
from November 1 to March 15, and during the decrease of the
moon, on account of the rapid decay of timber, through the
fermentation of its sap, if cut at other seasons. The burying
of wood in water, which dissolves out or alters its putrescible
constituents, has long been practised as a means of seasoning.
The old &ldquo;Resistance&rdquo; frigate, which went down in Malta
harbour, remained under water for some months, and on being
raised was found to be entirely freed from the dry rot fungus that
had previously covered her; similarly, in the ship &ldquo;Eden,&rdquo;
the progress of rot was completely arrested by 18 months&rsquo;
submergence in Plymouth Sound, so that after remaining a
year at home in excellent condition she was sent out to the
East Indies. It was an ancient practice in England to place
timber for thrashing-floors and oak planks for wainscotting in
running water to season them. Whale and other oils have been
recommended for the preservation of wood; and in 1737 a
patent for the employment of hot oil was taken out by a
Mr Emerson.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DUALISM<a name="ar81" id="ar81"></a></span> (from rare Lat. <i>dualis</i>, containing two, from <i>duo</i>),
a philosophical term applied to all theories which attempt to
explain facts by reference to two coexistent principles. The
term plays an important part in metaphysical, ethical and
theological speculation.</p>

<p><i>In Metaphysics.</i>&mdash;Metaphysical dualism postulates the eternal
coexistence of mind and matter, as opposed to monism
both idealistic and materialistic. Two forms of this dualism
are held. On the one hand it is said that mind and matter
are absolutely heterogeneous, and, therefore, that any causal
relation between them is <i>ex hypothesi</i> impossible. On the other
hand is a hypothetical dualism, according to which it is held
that mind cannot bridge over the chasm so far as to <i>know</i> matter
<i>in itself</i>, though it is compelled by its own laws of cause and
effect to postulate matter as the origin, if not the motive cause,
of its sensations. It follows that, for the thinking mind, matter
is a necessary hypothesis. Hence the theory is a kind of monism,
inasmuch as it confessedly does not assert the existence of matter
save as an intellectual postulate for the thinking mind. Matter,
in other words, must be assumed to exist, though mind cannot
know it <i>in itself</i>. From this question there emerges a second
and more difficult problem. Consciousness, it is held, is of two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page614" id="page614"></a>614</span>
main kinds, sensation and reason. Sensation alone is insufficient
to explain all our intellectual phenomena; all sensation is
momentary and individual (cf. Empiricism). How then are we
to account for memory and the principles of necessity, similarity,
universality? It is argued that there must be in the mind an
enduring, primary faculty whereby we retain, compare and
group the presentations of sense. This faculty is <i>a priori</i>,
transcendental, and entirely separate from all the data of experience
and sense-perception. Here then we have a dualism
within experience. The mind is not to be regarded as a sensitized
film which automatically records the impressions of the senses.
It contains within itself this modifying critical faculty which
reacts upon and arranges the sense-given presentations.</p>

<p><i>In Ethics and Theology.</i>&mdash;In the domain of morals, dualism
postulates the separate existence of Good and Evil, as principles
of existence. In theology the appearance of dualism is sporadic
and has not the fundamental, determining importance which it
has in metaphysics. It is a result rather than a starting-point.
The old Zoroastrianism, and those Christian sects (<i>e.g.</i> Manichaeism)
which were influenced by it, postulate two contending
deities Ormuzd and Ahriman (Good and Evil), which war
against one another in influencing the conduct of men. So, in
Christianity, the existence of Satan as an evil influence, antagonistic
to God, involves a kind of dualism. But generally speaking
this dualism is permissive, inasmuch as it is always held that God
will triumph over Satan in His own time. So in Zoroastrianism
the dualism is not ultimate, for Ahriman and Ormuzd are
represented as the twin sons of Zervana Akarana, <i>i.e.</i> limitless
time, wherein both will be finally absorbed. The postulate of an
Evil Being arises from the difficulty, at all times acutely felt by
a certain type of mind, of reconciling the existence of evil with
the divine attributes of perfect goodness, full knowledge and
infinite power. John Stuart Mill (<i>Essay on Religion</i>) preferred
to disbelieve in the omnipotence of God rather than forgo the
belief in His goodness. It follows from such a view that Satan
is not the creation of God, but rather a power coeval in origin,
over whose activity God has no absolute control.</p>

<p><i>In Theology.</i>&mdash;Dualism is also used in a special theological
sense to describe a doctrine of the Nestorian heresy. According
to this doctrine the personality of Christ is twofold; the divine
Logos dwells as a distinct personality in the man Jesus Christ,
the union of the two natures being analogous to the relation
between the believer and the indwelling Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><i>History of the Doctrine.</i>&mdash;The earliest European thinkers
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ionian School of Philosophy</a></span>) endeavoured to reduce
all the facts of the universe to a single material origin, such as
Fire, Water, Air. It is only gradually that there appears any
recognition of a spiritual principle exercising a modifying or
causal influence over inert matter. Anaxagoras was the first
to postulate the existence of Reason (<span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>) as the source of
change and progress. Yet even he did not conceive this Reason
as incorporeal; it was in reality only the most highly rarefied
form of matter in existence. In Plato for the first time we find
a truly dualistic conception of the universe. Asserting that
Ideas alone really exist, he yet found it necessary to postulate
a second principle of not-being, the groundwork of sensuous
existence and of imperfection and evil. Herein he identified
metaphysics and ethics, combining the good with the truly
existent and evil with the non-existent. Aristotle rebels against
this conception and substitutes the idea of <span class="grk" title="prôtê hylê">&#960;&#961;&#974;&#964;&#951; &#8021;&#955;&#951;</span> and development.
Nevertheless he does not escape from the dualism of
Form and Matter, <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> and <span class="grk" title="hylê">&#8021;&#955;&#951;</span>. The scholastic philosophers
naturally held dualistic views resulting from their extreme
devotion to formalism. This blind dualism found its natural
consequence in the revolt of the Renaissance thinkers, Bruno
and Paracelsus, who asserted the unity of mind and matter in
all existence and were the precursors of the more intelligent
monism of Leibnitz and the scientific metaphysics of his successors.
The birth of modern physical science on the other
hand in the investigations of Bacon and Descartes obscured the
metaphysical issue by the predominance of the mechanical
principles of natural philosophy. They attempted to explain
the fundamental problems of existence by the unaided evidence
of the new natural science. Thus Descartes maintained the
absolute dualism of the <i>res cogitans</i> and the <i>res extensa</i>. Spinoza
realized the flaw in the division and preferred to postulate
behind mind and matter a single substance (<i>unica substantia</i>)
while Leibnitz explained the universe as a harmony of spiritual
or semispiritual principles. Kant practically abandons the
problem. He never really establishes a relation between pure
reason and things-in-themselves (<i>Dinge an sich</i>), but rather seeks
refuge in a dualism within consciousness, the transcendental
and the empirical. Since Kant there are, therefore, two streams
of dualism, dealing, one with the radical problem of the relation
between mind and matter, the other with the relation between
the pure rational and the empirical elements within consciousness.
To the first problem there is one obvious and conclusive answer,
namely that matter in itself is inherently unthinkable and comes
within the vision of the mind only as an intellectual presentation.
It follows that philosophy is in a sense both dualist and monist;
it is a cosmic dualism inasmuch as it admits the possible existence
of matter as a hypothesis, though it denies the possibility of any
true knowledge of it, and is hence in regard of the only possible
knowledge an idealistic monism. It is a self-destructive dualism,
a confessedly one-sided monism, agnostic as to the fundamental
problem. To the second problem there are two main answers,
that of Associationism which denies to the mind any <i>a priori</i>
existence and asserts that sensation is the only source of knowledge,
and that which admits the existence of both transcendental
and empirical knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DUALLA,<a name="ar82" id="ar82"></a></span> one of the principal negro peoples of Cameroon
estuary, West Africa. When the Germans established themselves
in that region, the Dualla were under many petty chiefs, whose
domains were usually restricted to one village. Over these were
two greater chiefs, Bell (Mbeli) and Akwa, representing the
principal families of the tribe. The Dualla are physically a
fine race. They are proud of their racial purity, and it was
formerly usual for all half-caste children to be strangled at birth.
The Dualla tattoo themselves, the women the whole body, the
men the face only. They also pull out their eyelashes, which
they believe prevent sharp sight. The monarchical system is
more developed among the Dualla than any other of the peoples
of Cameroon. The kings, many of whom have grown rich through
trade, retain part of their former power, subject to the German
government. The Dualla, who are laborious, industrious and
capable of great physical endurance, are great traders and are
proportionately prosperous. The average price for a wife among
the Dualla is from £90 to £120; but sometimes a great deal more
is paid. Girls are usually betrothed young and may be divorced
if sterile. The penalty for adultery is a fine imposed on the
seducer; if he cannot pay he becomes the husband&rsquo;s slave.
Cannibalism as a religious rite was formerly common among
the Dualla. All accessions to power were preceded by a sacrifice,
a king having no authority till his hands were stained with blood.
The religion is fetish blended with ancestor-worship, and certain
secret societies exist among them which seem to have a religious
connexion. The dead are buried within the hut, which is abandoned
shortly afterwards; slaves were formerly buried with
men of importance. Missionary efforts have yielded many
converts, and some churches have been built. Many of the
natives can read. The Dualla are in possession of an interesting
code, in accordance with which messages can be sent and even
conversations maintained by means of drums, or rather gongs,
giving two notes. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cameroon</a></span>.)</p>

<p><span class="bold">DU BARRY, MARIE JEANNE BÉCU,<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> Comtesse (1746-1793),
French adventuress, mistress of Louis XV., was the
natural daughter of a poor woman of Vaucouleurs, and was
born there on the 19th of August 1746. Placed in a convent in
Paris at an early age, she received a very slight education,
learning little but the catechism and drawing; and at the age
of sixteen entered a milliner&rsquo;s shop in the rue St Honoré. Subsequently
she lived as a courtesan under the name of Mdlle Lange.
Her great personal charms led the adventurer Jean, comte du
Barry, to take her into his house in order to make it more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page615" id="page615"></a>615</span>
attractive to the dupes whose money he won by gambling. Her
success surpassing his expectations, his hopes took a higher
flight, and through Lebel, valet de chambre of Louis XV., and
the duc de Richelieu, he succeeded in installing her as mistress
of the king. In order to present her at court it was necessary to
find a title for her, and as Count Jean du Barry was married
himself his brother Guillaume offered himself as nominal
husband. The comtesse du Barry was presented at court on
the 22nd of April 1769, and became official mistress of the king.
Her influence over the monarch was absolute until his death,
and courtiers and ministers were in favour or disgrace with him
in exact accordance with her wishes. The duc de Choiseul, who
refused to acknowledge her, was disgraced in 1771; and the
duc d&rsquo;Aiguillon, who had the reputation of being her lover,
took his place, and in concert with her governed the monarch.
Louis XV. built for her the magnificent mansion of Luciennes.
At his death in 1774 an order of his successor banished her to
the abbey of Pont-aux-Dames, near Meaux, but, the queen
interceding for her, the king in the following year gave her
permission to reside at Luciennes with a pension. Here she led
a retired life with the comte de Cossé-Brissac, and was visited
there by Benjamin Franklin and the emperor Joseph II., among
many other distinguished men. Having gone to England in 1792
to endeavour to raise money on her jewels, she was on her return
accused before the Revolutionary Tribunal of having dissipated
the treasures of the state, conspired against the republic, and
worn, in London, &ldquo;mourning for the tyrant.&rdquo; She was condemned
to death on the 7th of December 1793, and beheaded
the same evening. Her contemporaries, scorning her low birth
rather than her vices, attributed to her a malicious political rôle
of which she was at heart incapable, and have done scant justice
to her quick wit, her frank but gracious manners, and her seductive
beauty. The volume of <i>Lettres et Anecdotes</i> (1779) which
bears her name was not written by her.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DU BARTAS, GUILLAUME DE SALUSTE,<a name="ar84" id="ar84"></a></span> <span class="sc">Seigneur</span> (1544-1590),
French poet, was born near Auch in 1544. He was
employed by Henry IV. of France in England, Denmark and
Scotland; and he commanded a troop of horse in Gascony,
under the marshal de Martingan. He was a convinced Huguenot,
and cherished the idea of writing a great religious epic in which
biblical characters and Christian sentiment were to supplant
the pagan <i>mise en scène</i> then in fashion. His first epic, <i>Judith</i>,
appeared in a volume entitled <i>La Muse chrétienne</i> (Bordeaux,
1573). This was followed five years later by his principal work,
<i>La Sepmaine</i>, a poem on the creation of the world. This work
was held by admirers of du Bartas to put him on a level with
Ronsard, and thirty editions of it were printed within six years
after its appearance. Its religious tone and fanciful style made
it a great favourite in England, where the author was called the
&ldquo;divine&rdquo; du Bartas, and placed on an equality with Ariosto.
Spenser, Hall and Ben Jonson, all speak in the highest terms of
what seems to us a most uninteresting poem. King James VI.
of Scotland tried his &ldquo;prentice hand&rdquo; at the translation of du
Bartas&rsquo;s poem <i>L&rsquo;Uranie</i>, and the compliment was returned by
the French writer, who translated, as <i>La Lepanthe</i>, James&rsquo;s poem
on the battle of Lepanto. Du Bartas began the publication of
the <i>Seconde Semaine</i> in 1584. He aimed at a great epic which
should stretch from the story of the creation to the coming of
the Messiah. Of this great scheme he only executed a part,
marked by a certain elevation of style, but he did not succeed in
acclimatizing the religious epic in France. The work is spoiled
by a constant tendency to moralize, and is filled with the indiscriminate
information that passed under the name of science
in the 16th century. Du Bartas, perhaps more than any other
writer, brought the Ronsardist tradition into dispute. He
introduced many unwieldy compounds foreign to the genius
of the French language, and in his borrowings from old French,
from provincial dialects and from Latin, he failed to show the
sure instinct and prudence of Ronsard and du Bellay. He was
also guilty of reduplicating the first syllables of words, producing
such expressions as <i>pépétiller</i>, <i>sousouflantes</i>. Du Bartas died
in July 1590 in Paris from wounds received at the battle of
Ivry.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Joshua Sylvester translated the <i>Sepmaine</i> in 1598; other English
translations from du Bartas are <i>The Historie of Judith ...</i> (1584),

Lisle (1569-1637), the Anglo-Saxon scholar; <i>Urania</i> (1589), by
Robert Ashley (1565-1641); and Sir Philip Sidney (see Florio&rsquo;s
dedication of the second book of his translation of Montaigne to
Lady Rich) wrote a translation of the first &ldquo;Week,&rdquo; which is lost.

Wholdaia (or Daly) Lake, in 104° 20&prime; W. and 60° 15&prime; N., and
flows northward to its confluence with the Thelon river, and
thence eastward to Chesterfield Inlet, an arm of Hudson Bay.
It passes through numerous lake-expansions, including Dubawnt
Lake, with an area of 1700 sq. m. and an altitude of 500 ft. above
the sea; Aberdeen, altitude 130 ft.; and Baker, 30 ft. From
the head of Wholdaia Lake to the head of Chesterfield Inlet is
750 m. and thence to the west coast of Hudson Bay 125 m. The
river is shallow, and banks and bed are chiefly composed of
boulders; grassy slopes, however, occur at intervals along its
banks, especially on the shores of Dubawnt Lake, and are the
feeding grounds of large bands of cariboo. Discovered in 1770
by Samuel Hearne, the Dubawnt was explored by J. B. Tyrrell
in 1893, and the Thelon by David Hanbury in 1899.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DU BELLAY, GUILLAUME,<a name="ar87" id="ar87"></a></span> <span class="sc">Sieur de Langey</span> (1491-1543),
French soldier and diplomat, was born at the château of Glatigny,
near Montmirail, in 1491. His father, Louis du Bellay-Langey
was a younger son of the Angevin family of du Bellay, which
from the 14th century was distinguished in the service of the
dukes of Anjou and afterwards of the kings of France; and
Louis had six sons, who were among the best servants of Francis I.
Guillaume, the eldest, is one of the most remarkable figures of
the time; a brave soldier, a humanist and a historian, he was
above all the most able diplomat at the command of Francis I.,
prodigiously active, and excelling in secret negotiations. He
entered the military service at an early age, was taken prisoner
at Pavia (1525) and shared the captivity of Francis I. His skill
and devotion attached him to the king. His missions to Spain,
Italy, England and Germany were innumerable; sent three
times to England in 1529-1530, he was occupied with the execution
of the treaty of Cambrai and also with the question of
Henry VIII.&rsquo;s divorce, and with the help of his brother Jean,
then bishop of Paris, he obtained a decision favourable to Henry
VIII. from the Sorbonne (July 2, 1530). From 1532 to 1536,
though he went three times to England, he was principally
employed in uniting the German princes against Charles V.;
in May 1532 he signed the treaty of Scheyern with the dukes
of Bavaria, the landgrave of Hesse, and the elector of Saxony,
and in January 1534 the treaty of Augsburg. During the war
of 1537 Francis I. sent him on missions to Piedmont; he was
governor of Turin from December 1537 till the end of 1539, and
subsequently replacing Marshal d&rsquo;Annebaut as governor of the
whole of Piedmont, he displayed great capacity in organization.
But at the end of 1542, overwhelmed by work, he was compelled
to return to France, and died near Lyons on the 9th of January
1543. Rabelais, an eye-witness, has left a moving story of his
death (<i>Pantagruel</i>, iii. ch. 21, and iv. ch. 27). He was buried
in the cathedral of Le Mans, where a monument was erected
to his memory, with the inscription, &ldquo;Ci gît Langey, dont la
plume et l&rsquo;épée Ont surmonté Cicéron et Pompée&rdquo;; Charles V.
is said to have remarked that Langey, by his own unaided efforts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page616" id="page616"></a>616</span>
did more mischief and thwarted more schemes than all the
French together.</p>

<p>Guillaume du Bellay was the devoted protector of freedom
of thought; without actually joining the reformers, he defended
the innovators against their fanatical opponents. In 1534-1535
he even tried, unsuccessfully, to bring about a meeting
between Francis I. and Melanchthon; and in 1541 he intervened
in favour of the Vaudois. Rabelais was the most famous of his
clients, and followed him to Piedmont from 1540 to 1542.
Guillaume was himself a valuable historian, and a clear and
precise writer. He imitated Livy in his <i>Ogdoades</i>, a history of
the rivalry between Francis I. and the emperor from 1521, of
which, though he had no time to finish it, important fragments
remain, inserted by his brother Martin du Bellay (d. 1559) in
his <i>Mémoires</i> (1569). The celebrated <i>Instructions</i>, reprinted as
<i>Traité de la discipline militaire</i> in 1554 and 1592, was formerly
attributed to him, but it has been proved that he could not have
written it (see Bayle, <i>Dict. Hist.</i> i. 502, and Jähns, <i>Geschichte der
Kriegswissenschaften</i>, i. 498 seq.); this work, however, is of the
highest value for the study of the military art of the 16th century;
in 1550 an Italian, in 1567 a Spanish, and in 1594 and 1619
German translations were published.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DU BELLAY, JEAN<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (c. 1493-1560), French cardinal and
diplomat, younger brother of Guillaume du Bellay, appears as
bishop of Bayonne in 1526, member of the privy council in 1530,
and bishop of Paris in 1532. Supple and clever, he was well
fitted for a diplomatic career, and carried out several missions
in England (1527-1534) and Rome (1534-1536). In 1535 he
received his cardinal&rsquo;s hat; in 1536-1537 he was nominated
&ldquo;lieutenant-general&rdquo; to the king at Paris and in the Île de
France, and was entrusted with the organization of the defence
against the imperialists. When Guillaume du Bellay went to
Piedmont, Jean was put in charge of the negotiations with the
German Protestants, principally through the humanist Johann
Sturm and the historian Johann Sleidan. In the last years of the
reign of Francis I., cardinal du Bellay was in favour with the
duchesse d&rsquo;Étampes, and received a number of benefices&mdash;the
bishopric of Limoges (1541), archbishopric of Bordeaux (1544),
bishopric of Le Mans (1546); but his influence in the council was
supplanted by that of Cardinal de Tournon. Under Henry II.,
being involved in the disgrace of all the servants of Francis I., he
was sent to Rome (1547), and he obtained eight votes in the conclave
which followed the death of Pope Paul III. After three quiet
years passed in retirement in France (1550-1553), he was charged
with a new mission to Pope Julius III. and took with him to Rome
his young cousin the poet Joachim du Bellay (<i>q.v.</i>). He lived
in Rome thenceforth in great state. In 1555 he was nominated
bishop of Ostia and dean of the Sacred College, an appointment
which was disapproved of by Henry II. and brought him into
fresh disgrace, lasting till his death in Rome on the 16th of
February 1560. Less resolute and reliable than his brother
Guillaume, the cardinal had brilliant qualities, and an open and
free mind. He was on the side of toleration and protected the
reformers. Budaeus was his friend, Rabelais his faithful secretary
and doctor; men of letters, like Étienne Dolet, and the poet
Salmon Macrin, were indebted to him for assistance. An orator
and writer of Latin verse, he left three books of graceful Latin
poems (printed with Salmon Macrin&rsquo;s <i>Odes</i>, 1546, by R. Estienne),
and some other compositions, including <i>Francisci Francorum
regis epistola apologetica</i> (1542). His voluminous correspondence,
mostly in MS., is remarkable for its <i>verve</i> and picturesque
quality.</p>

<p><span class="bold">DU BELLAY, JOACHIM<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> (c. 1522-1560), French poet and
critic, member of the Pléiade, was born<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> at the château of La
Turmelière, not far from Liré, near Angers, being the son of Jean
du Bellay, seigneur de Gonnor, cousin-german of the cardinal
Jean du Bellay and of Guillaume du Bellay. Both his parents
died while he was still a child, and he was left to the guardianship
of his elder brother, René du Bellay, who neglected his education,
leaving him to run wild at La Turmelière. When he was twenty-three,
however, he received permission to go to Poitiers to study
law, no doubt with a view to his obtaining perferment through
his kinsman the Cardinal Jean du Bellay. At Poitiers he came
in contact with the humanist Marc Antoine Muret, and with
Jean Salmon Macrin (1490-1557), a Latin poet famous in his
day. There too he probably met Jacques Peletier du Mans, who
had published a translation of the <i>Ars poëtica</i> of Horace, with a
preface in which much of the programme advocated later by the
Pléiade is to be found in outline.</p>

<p>It was probably in 1547 that du Bellay met Ronsard in an
inn on the way to Poitiers, an event which may justly be regarded
as the starting-point of the French school of Renaissance poetry.
The two had much in common, and immediately became fast
friends. Du Bellay returned with Ronsard to Paris to join the
circle of students of the humanities attached to Jean Daurat
(<i>q.v.</i>) at the Collège de Coqueret. While Ronsard and Antoine de
Baïf were most influenced by Greek models, du Bellay was more
especially a Latinist, and perhaps his preference for a language
so nearly connected with his own had some part in determining
the more national and familiar note of his poetry. In 1548
appeared the <i>Art poétique</i> of Thomas Sibilet, who enunciated
many of the ideas that Ronsard and his followers had at heart,
though with essential differences in the point of view, since he
held up as models Clément Marot and his disciples. Ronsard
and his friends dissented violently from Sibilet on this and other
points, and they doubtless felt a natural resentment at finding
their ideas forestalled and, moreover, inadequately presented.
The famous manifesto of the Pléiade, the <i>Deffence et illustration
de la langue françoyse</i> (1549), was at once a complement and a
refutation of Sibilet&rsquo;s treatise. This book was the expression
of the literary principles of the Pléiade as a whole, but although
Ronsard was the chosen leader, its redaction was entrusted to
du Bellay. To obtain a clear view of the reforms aimed at by
the Pléiade, the <i>Deffence</i> should be further considered in connexion
with Ronsard&rsquo;s <i>Abrégé d&rsquo;art poétique</i> and his preface to
the <i>Franciade</i>. Du Bellay maintained that the French language
as it was then constituted was too poor to serve as a medium
for the higher forms of poetry, but he contended that by proper
cultivation it might be brought on a level with the classical
tongues. He condemned those who despaired of their mother
tongue, and used Latin for their more serious and ambitious
work. For translations from the ancients he would substitute
imitations. Not only were the forms of classical poetry to be
imitated, but a separate poetic language and style, distinct from
those employed in prose, were to be used. The French language
was to be enriched by a development of its internal resources and
by discreet borrowing from the Latin and Greek. Both du Bellay
and Ronsard laid stress on the necessity of prudence in these
borrowings, and both repudiated the charge of wishing to latinize
their mother tongue. The book was a spirited defence of poetry
and of the possibilities of the French language; it was also a
declaration of war on those writers who held less heroic views.</p>

<p>The violent attacks made by du Bellay on Marot and his
followers, and on Sibilet, did not go unanswered. Sibilet replied
in the preface to his translation (1549) of the <i>Iphigenia</i> of Euripides;
Guillaume des Autels, a Lyonnese poet, reproached
du Bellay with ingratitude to his predecessors, and showed the
weakness of his argument for imitation as opposed to translation
in a digression in his <i>Réplique aux furieuses défenses de Louis
Meigret</i> (Lyons, 1550); Barthélemy Aneau, regent of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page617" id="page617"></a>617</span>
Collège de la Trinité at Lyons, attacked him in his <i>Quintil Horatian</i>
(Lyons, 1551), the authorship of which was commonly attributed
to Charles Fontaine. Aneau pointed out the obvious inconsistency
of inculcating imitation of the ancients and depreciating
native poets in a work professing to be a defence of the French
language. Du Bellay replied to his various assailants in a preface
to the second edition (1550) of his sonnet sequence <i>Olive</i>, with
which he also published two polemical poems, the <i>Musagnaeomachie</i>,
and an ode addressed to Ronsard, <i>Contre les envieux
poètes</i>. <i>Olive</i>, a collection of love-sonnets written in close
imitation of Petrarch, first appeared in 1549. With it were
printed thirteen odes entitled <i>Vers lyriques</i>. Olive has been
supposed to be an anagram for the name of a Mlle Viole, but
there is little evidence of real passion in the poems, and they
may perhaps be regarded as a Petrarcan exercise, especially
as, in the second edition, the dedication to his lady is exchanged
for one to Marguerite de Valois, sister of Henry II. Du Bellay
did not actually introduce the sonnet into French poetry, but
he acclimatized it; and when the fashion of sonneteering became
a mania he was one of the first to ridicule its excesses.</p>

<p>About this time du Bellay had a serious illness of two years&rsquo;
duration, from which dates the beginning of his deafness. He had
further anxieties in the guardianship of his nephew. The boy
died in 1553, and Joachim, who had up to this time borne the
title of sieur de Liré, became seigneur of Gonnor. In 1549 he had
published a <i>Recueil de poësies</i> dedicated to the Princess Marguerite.
This was followed in 1552 by a version of the fourth book of
the <i>Aeneid</i>, with other translations and some occasional poems.
In the next year he went to Rome as one of the secretaries of
Cardinal du Bellay. To the beginning of his four and a half years&rsquo;
residence in Italy belong the forty-seven sonnets of his <i>Antiquités
de Rome</i>, which were rendered into English by Edmund Spenser
(<i>The Ruins of Rome</i>, 1591). These sonnets were more personal
and less imitative than the <i>Olive</i> sequence, and struck a note
which was revived in later French literature by Volney and
Chateaubriand. His stay in Rome was, however, a real exile.
His duties were those of an intendant. He had to meet the
cardinal&rsquo;s creditors and to find money for the expenses of the
household. Nevertheless he found many friends among Italian
scholars, and formed a close friendship with another exiled poet
whose circumstances were similar to his own, Olivier de Magny.
Towards the end of his sojourn in Rome he fell violently in love
with a Roman lady called Faustine, who appears in his poetry
as Columba and Columbelle. This passion finds its clearest
expression in the Latin poems. Faustine was guarded by an
old and jealous husband, and du Bellay&rsquo;s eventual conquest
may have had something to do with his departure for Paris at
the end of August 1557. In the next year he published the poems
he had brought back with him from Rome, the Latin <i>Poemata</i>,
the <i>Antiquités de Rome</i>, the <i>Jeux rustiques</i>, and the 191 sonnets
of the <i>Regrets</i>, the greater number of which were written in Italy.
The <i>Regrets</i> show that he had advanced far beyond the theories of
the <i>Deffence</i>. The simplicity and tenderness specially characteristic
of du Bellay appear in the sonnets telling of his unlucky passion
for Faustine, and of his nostalgia for the banks of the Loire.
Among them are some satirical sonnets describing Roman
manners, and the later ones written after his return to Paris
are often appeals for patronage. His intimate relations with
Ronsard were not renewed; but he formed a close friendship
with the scholar Jean de Morel, whose house was the centre of a
learned society. In 1559 du Bellay published at Poitiers <i>La
Nouvelle Manière de faire son profit des lettres</i>, a satirical epistle
translated from the Latin of Adrien Turnèbe, and with it <i>Le Poète
courtisan</i>, which introduced the formal satire into French poetry.
These were published under the pseudonym of J. Quintil du
Troussay, and the courtier-poet was generally supposed to be
Melin de Saint-Gelais, with whom du Bellay had always, however,
been on friendly terms.</p>

<p>A long and eloquent <i>Discours au roi</i> (detailing the duties of a
prince, and translated from a Latin original written by Michel
de l&rsquo;Hôpital, now lost) was dedicated to Francis II. in 1559,
and is said to have secured for the poet a tardy pension. In
Paris he was still in the employ of the cardinal, who delegated
to him the lay patronage which he still retained in the diocese.
In the exercise of these functions Joachim quarrelled with
Eustache du Bellay, bishop of Paris, who prejudiced his relations
with the cardinal, less cordial since the publication of the outspoken
<i>Regrets</i>. His chief patron, Marguerite de Valois, to whom
he was sincerely attached, had gone to Savoy. Du Bellay&rsquo;s health
was weak; his deafness seriously hindered his official duties;
and on the 1st of January 1560 he died. There is no evidence that
he was in priest&rsquo;s orders, but he was a clerk, and as such held
various preferments. He had at one time been a canon of Notre
Dame of Paris, and was accordingly buried in the cathedral.
The statement that he was nominated archbishop of Bordeaux
during the last year of life is unauthenticated by documentary
evidence and is in itself extremely improbable.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DUBLIN,<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> a county of Ireland in the province of Leinster,
bounded N. by Co. Meath, E. by the Irish Sea, S. by Wicklow,
and W. by Kildare and Meath. With the exception of Louth
and Carlow, Dublin is the smallest county in Ireland, having an
area of 218,873 acres, or about 342 sq. m. The northern portion
is flat, and the soil good, particularly on the borders of Meath;
but on the southern side the land rises into elevations of considerable
height. The mountains are chiefly covered with heath,
except where a subsidence in the ground affords a nucleus for
the formation of bog, with which about 2000 acres are covered.
There are also a few small tracts of bog in the northern part of
the county. The mountain district is well adapted for timber.
The northern coast of the county from Balbriggan to Howth
has generally a sandy shore, and affords only the small harbours
of Balbriggan and Skerries. In the promontory of Howth, the
coast suddenly assumes a bolder aspect; and between the town
of Howth and the rocky islet of Ireland&rsquo;s Eye an unsuccessful
artificial harbour was constructed. Kingstown harbour on the
south side of Dublin Bay superseded this, and is by far the best
in the county. Dalkey Island, about 22 acres in extent, lies
about midway between Kingstown harbour and the beautiful
bay of Killiney. North of Howth lies Lambay Island, about 600
acres in area. Shell fish, especially lobsters, are taken here in
abundance. Small islets lie farther north off Skerries; the most
interesting of which is that known as Inispatrick, reputed as the
first landing-place of St Patrick, and having the ruins of a church
said to be the saint&rsquo;s first foundation, though it shares this
reputation with other sites. Ireland&rsquo;s Eye, off Howth, is a very
picturesque rock with about 54 acres of grass land. It has
afforded great room for geological disquisition. The chief river
in the county is the Liffey, which rises in the Wicklow mountains
about 12 m. S.W. of Dublin, and, after running about 50 m.,
empties itself into Dublin Bay. The course of the river is so
tortuous that 40 m. may be traversed and only 10 gained in
direction. The scenery along the banks of the Liffey is remarkably
beautiful. The mountains which occupy the southern
border of the county are the extremities of the great group
belonging to the adjacent county Wicklow. The principal
summits are the group containing Glendoo (1919 ft.) and Two
Rock (1699 ft.) within the county, and the border group of
Kippure, reaching in that summit a height of 2475 ft. The
grandest features of these hills are the great natural ravines
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page618" id="page618"></a>618</span>
which open in them, the most extraordinary being the Scalp
through which the traveller passes from Dublin to Wicklow.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;On the north a Silurian upland stretches, falling to the
sea at Balbriggan, where fossiliferous strata contain contemporaneous
volcanic rocks. A limestone of Bala age comes out under shales and
andesites in the promontory of Portrane, and rocks of the same
series occur in the bold island of Lambay, associated with a large
mass of dark green porphyritic andesite (the &ldquo;Lambay porphyry&rdquo;).
Silurian rocks reappear at Tallaght in the south-west, where the
granite of Leinster rises through them, forming a moorland 2000 ft.
in height only a few miles south of Dublin. Old Red Sandstone,
seen at Donabate and Newcastle, leads up into Carboniferous Limestone,
which is often darkened by mud and even shaly (&ldquo;calpy&rdquo;
type). This rock produces a fairly level country, both north and
south of the valley of the Liffey, although the beds are greatly
folded. Beds of a higher Carboniferous zone are retained in synclinals
near Rush. The rugged peninsula of Howth, connected
by a raised bench with the mainland, is formed of old quartzites
and shales, crushed and folded, and probably of Cambrian age.
The rocks of the county show many signs of ice-action, and boulder-clays
and drift-gravels cover the lowland, the latter being banked up
on the mountain-slopes to heights of 1200 ft. or more. Much of this
glacial material has been imported from the area of the Irish Sea.
Lead-ore has been mined at the granite-contact at Ballycorus.</p>

<p><i>Industries.</i>&mdash;The extension of Dublin city and its suburbs has no
doubt had its influence on the decrease of acreage under both tillage
and pasture. Oats and potatoes are the principal crops, but live
stock, especially cattle, receives greater attention. A large proportion
of holdings are of the smallest, nearly one-half of those
beneath fifteen acres being also beneath one acre. The manufactures
of the county are mainly confined to the city and suburbs, but there
is manufacture of cotton hosiery at Balbriggan. The haddock,
herring and other fisheries, both deep-sea and coastal, are important,
and Kingstown is the headquarters of the fishery district. The
salmon fishery district of Dublin also affords considerable employment.
As containing the metropolis of Ireland, the communications
of the county are naturally good, several important railways and
two canals converging upon the city of Dublin, under the head of
which they are considered.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;The population (148,210 in
1891; 157,568 in 1901) shows a regular increase, which, however,
is not consistent from year to year. About 70% are Roman
Catholics, the Protestant Episcopalians (24%) standing next.
The chief towns, apart from the capital, are Balbriggan (pop.
2236), Blackrock (8719), Dalkey (3398), Killiney and Ballybrack
(2744), Pembroke (25,799), Rathmines and Rathgar (32,602),
and the important port of Kingstown (17,377). These are urban
districts. Skerries, Howth and Rush are small maritime towns.
There are nine baronies in the county, which, including the city
of Dublin, are divided into 100 parishes, all within the Protestant
and Roman Catholic dioceses of Dublin. Assizes are held in
Dublin, and quarter sessions also in the capital, and at Balbriggan,
Kilmainham, Kingstown and Swords. Previous to the
union with Great Britain, this county returned ten representatives
to the Irish Parliament,&mdash;two for the county, two for the city,
two for the university, and two for each of the boroughs of
Swords and Newcastle. The county parliamentary divisions are
now two, north and south, each returning one member. The
city of Dublin constitutes a separate county.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Dublin is among the counties generally considered
to have been formed by King John, and comprised the chief
portion of country within the English pale. The limits of the
county, however, were uncertain, and underwent many changes
before they were fixed. As late as the 17th century the mountainous
country south of Dublin offered a retreat to the lawless,
and it was not until 1606 that the boundaries of the county
received definition in this direction, along with the formation
of the county Wicklow. Although so near the seat of government
67,142 acres of profitable land were forfeited in the Rebellion of
1641 and 34,536 acres in the Revolution of 1688. In 1867 the
most formidable of the Fenian risings took place near the village
of Tallaght, about 7 m. from the city. The rebels, who numbered
from 500 to 700, were found wandering at dawn, some by a small
force of constabulary who, having in vain called upon them to
yield, fired and wounded five of them; but the great bulk of
them were overtaken by the troops under Lord Strathnairn,
who captured them with ease and marched them into the city.
There are numerous antiquities in the county. Raths or encampments
are frequent, and those at Raheny, Coolock, Lucan,
with the large specimen at Shankill or Rathmichael near the
Scalp pass may be mentioned. Cromlechs occur in Phoenix
Park, Dublin, at Howth, and elsewhere. There are fine round
towers at Swords, Lusk and Clondalkin, and there is the stump
of one at Rathmichael.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">DUBLIN,<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> a city, county of a city, parliamentary borough
and seaport, and the metropolis of Ireland, in the province of
Leinster. It lies at the head of a bay of the Irish Sea, to which
it gives name, about midway on the eastern coast of the island,
334 m. W.N.W. of London by the Holyhead route, and 70 m. W.
of Holyhead on the coast of Anglesey, Wales. (For map, see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ireland</a></span>.) Its population in 1901 was 290,638.</p>

<p><i>Site, Streets and Buildings.</i>&mdash;Dublin lies on the great central
limestone district which stretches across the island from the Irish
Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, and occupies both banks of the river
Liffey. Its situation is justly admired. The populous shores
of the bay are exceedingly picturesque. To the north and west
the country is comparatively level, the central plain of Ireland
here reaching to the coast, but to the south the foothills of the
Wicklow Mountains practically touch the confines of Greater
Dublin, affording comprehensive views of the physical position
of the city, and forming a background to some of the finest
streets. The municipal boundary lies generally a little outside
the so-called Circular Road, which may be taken as encircling
the city proper, with a few breaks. It bears this name on both
the north and south sides of the river. As the city is approached
from the bay, the river Liffey, which divides the city from west
to east roughly into two equal parts, is seen to be lined with a
fine series of quays. At its mouth, on the north side, is the
North Wall quay, where the principal steamers lie, and in this
vicinity are the docks. At the opposite (western) end of the
city, the Phoenix Park may be taken as a convenient landmark.
Between this and North Wall the river is crossed by twelve
bridges, which, in order from west to east, are these:&mdash;Sarah
Bridge, the bridge of the North Wall extension railway; King&rsquo;s,
commemorating a visit of George IV.; Victoria or Barrack;
Queen&rsquo;s; Whitworth, of interest as occupying the site where a
bridge has stood since the 12th century; Richmond, Grattan
and Wellington; O&rsquo;Connell, Butt and a swivel bridge carrying
a loop railway. Of these O&rsquo;Connell bridge (formerly known as
Carlisle) is the principal, as it connects the chief thoroughfare
on the north side, namely Sackville (or O&rsquo;Connell) Street, with
Great Brunswick Street and others on the south. Sackville
Street, which gains in appearance from its remarkable breadth,
contains the principal hotels, and the post office, with a fine
Ionic portico, founded in 1815. At the crossing of Henry Street
and Earl Street is the Nelson pillar, a beautiful monument 134 ft.
in height, consisting of a fluted Doric column, raised on a massive
pedestal, and crowned by a statue of the admiral. At the southern
end of the street is Daniel O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s monument, almost completed
by John Henry Foley before his death, and erected in
1882. In Rutland Square, at the northern end, is the Rotunda,
containing public rooms for meetings, and adjoining it, the
Rotunda hospital with its Doric façade.</p>

<p>From the north end of Sackville Street, several large thoroughfares
radiate through the northern part of the city, ultimately
joining the Circular Road at various points. To the west there
are the Broadstone station, Dominion Street, and beyond this
the large workhouse, prison, asylum and other district buildings,
while the Royal barracks front the river behind Albert Quay.
Two other notable buildings face the river on the north bank.
Between Whitworth and Richmond bridges stands the &ldquo;Four
Courts&rdquo; (law courts), on the site of the ancient Dominican
monastery of St Saviour. It was erected between 1786 and 1796,
and is adjoined by other court buildings, the public record office,
containing a vast collection, and the police offices. Below the
lowest bridge on the river, and therefore in the neighbourhood
of the shipping quarter, is the customs house (1781-1791),
considered one of the chief ornaments of the city. It presents
four fronts, that facing the river being of Portland stone, in the
Doric order, while the rest are of granite. The centre is crowned
by a dome, surmounted by a statue of Hope. This building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page619" id="page619"></a>619</span>
provides offices for the Local Government Board, Boards of
Trade and of Public Works and other bodies.</p>

<p>It is, however, to the south of the river that the most interesting
buildings are found. Crossing O&rsquo;Connell bridge, the short
Westmoreland Street strikes into a thoroughfare which traverses
the entire city parallel with the river, and is known successively
(from west to east) as James, Thomas, High, Castle, Dame,
College and Great Brunswick streets. At the end of Westmoreland
Street a fine group of buildings is seen&mdash;Trinity College
on the left and the Bank of Ireland on the right. Barely half a
mile westward down Dame Street, rises the Castle, and 300 yds.
beyond this again is the cathedral of Christ Church. These,
with the second cathedral of St Patrick, are more conveniently
described in the inverse order.</p>

<p>The cathedral of Christ Church, or Holy Trinity, the older
of the two Protestant cathedrals in the possession of which
Dublin is remarkable, was founded by Sigtryg, a
Christianized king of the Danes of Dublin, in 1038,
<span class="sidenote">Christ Church.</span>
but dates its elevation to a deanery and chapter from
1541. It was restored in 1870-1877 by G. E. Street at the charge
of Mr Henry Roe, a merchant of Dublin, who also presented
the Synod House. The restoration involved the complete rebuilding
of the choir and the south side of the nave, but the
model of the ancient building was followed with great care.
The crypt embodies remains of the founder&rsquo;s work; the rest
is Transitional Norman and Early English in style. Among the
monuments is that of Strongbow, the invader of Ireland, to
whom the earlier part of the superstructure (1170) is due. Here
the tenants of the church lands were accustomed to pay their
rents. The monument was injured by the fall of one of the
cathedral walls, but was repaired. By its side is a smaller tomb,
ascribed to Strongbow&rsquo;s son, whom his father killed for showing
cowardice in battle. Synods were occasionally held in this
church, and parliaments also, before the Commons&rsquo; Hall was
destroyed in 1566 by an accidental explosion of gunpowder.
Here also the pretender Lambert Simnel was crowned.</p>

<p>A short distance south from Christ Church, through the
squalid quarter of Nicholas and Patrick streets, stands the
other Protestant cathedral dedicated to St Patrick,
the foundation of which was an attempt to supersede
<span class="sidenote">St Patrick&rsquo;s.</span>
the older foundation of Christ Church, owing to jealousies,
both ecclesiastical and political, arising out of the Anglo-Norman
invasion. It was founded about 1190 by John Comyn,
archbishop of Dublin; but there was a church dedicated to the
same saint before. It was burnt about two hundred years
later, but was raised from its ruins with increased splendour.
At the Reformation it was deprived of its status as a cathedral,
and the building was used for some of the purposes of the courts
of justice. Edward VI. contemplated its change into a university,
but the project was defeated. In the succeeding reign
of Mary, St Patrick&rsquo;s was restored to its primary destination.
The installations of the knights of St Patrick, the first of which
took place in 1783, were originally held here, and some of their
insignia are preserved in the choir. This cathedral contains the
monuments of several illustrious persons, amongst which the
most celebrated are those of Swift (dean of this cathedral), of
Mrs Hester Johnson, immortalized under the name of &ldquo;Stella&rdquo;;
of Archbishop Marsh; of the first earl of Cork; and of Duke
Schomberg, who fell at the battle of the Boyne. The tablet over
Schomberg&rsquo;s grave contains what Macaulay called a &ldquo;furious
libel,&rdquo; though it only states that the duke&rsquo;s relatives refused
the expense of the tablet. In the cathedral may be seen the
chain ball which killed General St Ruth at the battle of Aughrim,
and the spurs which he wore. The cathedral was restored by
Sir Benjamin Lee Guinness (1864), whom a fine statue by John
Henry Foley commemorates, and the work was resumed by his
son Lord Iveagh in 1900. Attached to the cathedral is Marsh&rsquo;s
library, incorporated in 1707, by a request of Primate Marsh,
archbishop of Armagh. It contains a good number of theological
works and of manuscripts, and is open to the public; but is
deficient in modern publications.</p>

<p>Dublin Castle stands high, and occupies about ten acres of
ground, but excepting St Patrick&rsquo;s Hall, the apartments are
small, and the building is of a motley and unimposing appearance,
with the exception of the chapel (a Gothic building
<span class="sidenote">The Castle.</span>
of the early 19th century) and great tower. The castle
was originally built in the first two decades of the
13th century; and there are portions of this period, but nearly
the whole is of the 16th century and later. In St Patrick&rsquo;s hall
where the knights of St Patrick are invested, are the banners
of that order. Opposite the castle is the city hall (1779), in the
possession of the corporation, with statues in the central hall of
George III., of Grattan (a superb work by Sir Francis Chantry),
of Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, and of Thomas Drummond by John Hogan
and several others.</p>

<p>The Bank of Ireland (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Architecture</a></span>, fig. 85) occupies
five acres, and was formerly the House of Parliament. There
are three fronts; the principal, towards College
Green, is a colonnade of the Ionic order, with façade
<span class="sidenote">Bank of Ireland.</span>
and two projecting wings; it connects with the
western portico by a colonnade of the same order, forming the
quadrant of a circle. The eastern front, which was the entrance
of the House of Lords, is, by their special wish, of the Corinthian
order, made conformable with the rest of the building not without
difficulty to the architect. The House of Lords contains tapestry
dating from 1733, and remains in its original condition, but the
octagonal House of Commons was demolished by the bank
directors, and replaced with a cash-office. The building was
begun in 1729, but the fronts date from the end of the century;
the remodelling took place in 1803.</p>

<p>Trinity College, or Dublin University, fronts the street with
a Palladian façade (1759), with two good statues by Foley, of
Goldsmith and Burke. Above the gateway is a hall
called the Regent House. The first quadrangle,
<span class="sidenote">Trinity College.</span>
Parliament Square, contains the chapel (1798), with
a Corinthian portico, the public theatre or examination hall
(1787), containing portraits of Queen Elizabeth, Molyneux,
Burke, Bishop Berkeley and other celebrities, and the wain-scotted
dining hall, also containing portraits. A beautiful
modern campanile (1853), erected by Lord John George Beresford,
archbishop of Armagh and chancellor of the university, occupies
the centre of the square. Library Square takes its name from
the library, which is one of the four scheduled in the Copyright
Act as entitled to receive a copy of every volume published in
the United Kingdom. There is a notable collection of early
Irish manuscripts, including the magnificently ornamented
Book of Kells, containing the gospels. The building was begun
in 1712. In this square are the oldest buildings of the foundation,
dating in part from the close of the 17th century, and the modern
Graduates&rsquo; Memorial buildings (1904). These contain a theatre,
library and reading-room, the rooms of the college societies
and others. The schools form a fine modern pile (1856), and
other buildings are the provost&rsquo;s house (1760), printing house
(1760), museum (1857) and the medical school buildings, in three
blocks, one of the best schools in the kingdom. Other buildings
of the 20th century include chemical laboratories. The College
Park and Fellows&rsquo; Garden are of considerable beauty. In the
former most of the recreations of the students take place; but
the college also supports a well-known rowing-club. The college
observatory is at Dunsink, about 5 m. north-west of Dublin;
it is amply furnished with astronomical instruments. It was
endowed by Dr Francis Andrews, provost of Trinity College,
was erected in 1785, and in 1791 was placed by statute under
the management of the royal astronomer of Ireland, whose
official residence is here. The magnetic observatory of Dublin
was erected in the years 1837-1838 in the gardens attached to
Trinity College, at the expense of the university. A normal
climatological station was established in the Fellows&rsquo; Garden in
1904. The botanic garden is at Ball&rsquo;s Bridge, 1 m. S.E. of the
college.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The alternative title of Dublin University or Trinity College,
Dublin (commonly abbreviated T.C.D.), is explained by the fact that
the university consists of only one college, that of &ldquo;the Holy and
Undivided Trinity.&rdquo; This was founded under charter from Queen
Elizabeth in 1591, and is the greatest foundation of its kind in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page620" id="page620"></a>620</span>
country. The corporation consists of a provost, 7 senior fellows,
25 junior fellows and 70 scholars. A vacancy among the fellows is
filled up by the provost and a select number of the fellows, after
examination comprised in five principal courses, mathematics,
experimental science, classics, mental and moral science and Hebrew.
Fellowships are held for life. Until the year 1840 the fellows were
bound to celibacy, but that restriction was then removed. All except
five (medical and law fellows) were bound to take Holy Orders until
1872. The scholars on the foundation (or &ldquo;of the House&rdquo;) are
chosen from among the undergraduates, for merit in classics, mathematics
or experimental science. The pecuniary advantages attaching
to scholarship (£20 Irish, free commons, and rooms at half the charge
made to other students) last for four years. Students after an
examination are admitted as fellow-commoners, pensioners or sizars.
Fellow-commoners, who have decreased in numbers in modern times,
pay higher fees than the ordinary undergraduates or pensioners, and
have certain advantages of precedence, including the right of dining
at the fellows&rsquo; table. Sizarships are awarded on examination to
students of limited means, and carry certain relaxations of fees.
They were formerly given on the nomination of fellows. Noblemen,
noblemen&rsquo;s sons and baronets (<i>nobilis, filius nobilis, eques</i>) have the
privilege of forming a separate order with peculiar advantages, on the
payment of additional charges. The mode of admission to the university
is in all cases by examination. Various exhibitions and prizes are
awarded both in connexion with the entrance of students and at
subsequent stages of the course of instruction, which normally lasts
four years. There are three terms in each year&mdash;Michaelmas (beginning
the Academic year), Hilary and Trinity. The undergraduate is
called in his first year a junior freshman, in his second a senior
freshman, in his third a junior sophister, and in his fourth a senior
sophister. The usual arts and scientific courses are provided, and
there are four professional schools&mdash;divinity, law, physic and
engineering. The undergraduate has certain examinations in each
year, and four &ldquo;commencements&rdquo; are held every year for the
purpose of conferring degrees. Freedom is offered to students who
wish to be transferred from Oxford, Cambridge, or certain colonial
universities to Trinity College, by the recognition of terms kept in the
former institutions as part of the necessary course at Trinity College.
In 1903 it was decided to bestow degrees on women, and in 1904
to establish women&rsquo;s scholarships. The funds of the college, arising
from lands and the fees of students, are managed solely by the
provost and seven senior fellows, who form a board, to which and
to the academic council the whole government of the university,
both in its executive and its legislative branches, is committed.
The council consists of the provost and sixteen members of the
senate elected by the fellows, professors, &amp;c; the senate consists
of the chancellor or his deputy and doctors and masters who keep
their names on the books. The average number of students on the
books is about 1300. By an act passed in 1873, known as Fawcett&rsquo;s
Act, all tests were abolished, and the prizes and honours of all
grades hitherto reserved for Protestants of the Established Church
were thrown open to all. The university returns two members to
parliament. (See <i>Dublin University Calendar</i>, annual.)</p>
</div>

<p>There remain to be mentioned the following buildings in
Dublin. The permanent building of the International Exhibition
of 1865 adjoins the pleasure ground of St Stephen&rsquo;s Green.
This building was occupied by the Royal University of Ireland
until its dissolution under the Irish Universities Act 1908, which
provided for a new university at Dublin, to which the building
was transferred under the act (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ireland</a></span>: <i>Education</i>). The
new university is called the National University of Ireland.
At the same time a new college was founded under the name of
University College. The Royal University replaced the Queen&rsquo;s
University under the University Act (Ireland) in 1879. No
teaching was carried on, but examinations were held and degrees
conferred, both on men and on women. On the west side of St
Stephen&rsquo;s Green is the Catholic University (1854), which is under
the Jesuit Fathers and affiliated to the Royal University.
Between Trinity College and St Stephen&rsquo;s Green, a large group
of buildings includes the Royal Dublin Society, founded in
1683 to develop agriculture and the useful arts, with a library
and gallery of statuary; the Science and Arts Museum, and the
National Library, the former with a noteworthy collection of
Irish antiquities; the Museum of Natural History, with a splendid
collection of Irish fauna; and the National Gallery of Ireland,
founded in 1853. Here was once a residence of the duke of
Leinster, and the buildings surround the open space of Leinster
Lawn. Educational foundations include the Royal College
of Physicians, of Surgeons and of Science; the Royal Irish
Academy, with an unequalled collection of national antiquities,
including manuscripts and a library; and the Royal Hibernian
Academy of painting, sculpture and architecture. In 1904 the
formation of a municipally supported gallery of modern art
(mainly due to the initiative and generosity of Mr Hugh Lane)
was signalized by an exhibition including the pictures intended
to constitute the nucleus of the gallery. In 1905 King Edward
VII. laid the foundation stone of a college of science on a site
in the vicinity of Leinster Lawn. The full scheme for the occupation
of the site included, not only the college, but also offices
for the Board of Works and the Department of Agriculture.
The famous Dublin Horse and Agricultural Shows are held at
Ball&rsquo;s Bridge in April, August and December.</p>

<p>The most notable churches apart from the cathedrals are
Roman Catholic and principally modern. The lofty church of the
Augustinians in Thomas Street; St Mary&rsquo;s, the pro-cathedral,
in Marlborough Street, with Grecian ornamentation within,
and a Doric portico; St Paul&rsquo;s on Arran Quay, in the Ionic
style; and the striking St Francis Xavier in Gardiner Street,
also Ionic, are all noteworthy, and the last is one of the finest
modern churches in Ireland. Among theatres Dublin has, in
the Royal, a handsome building which replaced the old Theatre
Royal, burnt down in 1880. Clubs, which are numerous, are
chiefly found in the neighbourhood of Sackville Street; and
there should further be mentioned the Rotunda, at the corner
of Great Britain Street and Sackville Street, a beautiful building
of its kind, belonging to the adjacent hospital, and used for
concerts and other entertainments, while its gardens are used
for agricultural shows.</p>

<p><i>Suburbs.</i>&mdash;To the west of the city lies the Phoenix Park. Here,
besides the viceregal demesne and lodge and the magazine, are
a zoological garden, a people&rsquo;s garden, the Wellington monument,
two barracks, the Hibernian military school, the &ldquo;Fifteen Acres,&rdquo;
a natural amphitheatre (of much greater extent than its name
implies) used as a review ground, and a racecourse. The
amenities of Phoenix Park were enhanced in 1905 by the purchase
for the crown of land extending along the Liffey from Island
bridge to Chapelizod, which might otherwise have been built over.
To the south lies Kilmainham. Here is the royal hospital for
pensioners and maimed soldiers. Close by is Kilmainham prison.
To the west the valley of the Liffey affords pleasant scenery,
with the well-known grounds called the &ldquo;Strawberry Beds&rdquo;
on the north bank. In this direction lies Chapelizod, said to
take its name from that Iseult whom Tennyson, Matthew Arnold
and Wagner made a heroine; beyond which is Lucan connected
with the city by tramway. Northward lies Clondalkin, with its
round tower, marking the site of the important early see of
Cluain Dolcain; Glasnevin, with famous botanical gardens;
Finglas, with a ruined church of early foundation, and an Irish
cross; and Clontarf, a favoured resort on the bay, with its
modern castle and many residences of the wealthy classes in the
vicinity. South of the city are Rathmines, a populous suburb,
near which, at the &ldquo;Bloody Fields,&rdquo; English colonists were
murdered by the natives in 1209; and Donnybrook, celebrated
for its former fair. Rathmines, Monkstown, Clontarf, Dalkey
and Killiney, with the neighbourhood of Kingstown and Pembroke,
are the most favoured residential districts. Howth,
Malahide and Sutton to the north, and Bray to the south, are
favoured seaside watering-places outside the radius of actual
suburbs.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;The direct route to Dublin from London and
other parts of England is by the Holyhead route, controlled by
the London &amp; North Western railway with steamers to the port
of Dublin itself, while the company also works in conjunction
with the mail steamers of the City of Dublin Steam Packet
Company to the outlying port of Kingstown, 7 m. S.E. Passenger
steamers, however, also serve Liverpool, Heysham, Bristol, the
south coast ports of England and London; Edinburgh and
Glasgow, and other ports of Great Britain. The railways leaving
Dublin are the following: the Great Northern, with its terminus
in Amiens Street, with suburban lines, and a main line running
north to Drogheda, Dundalk and Belfast, with ramifications
through the northern countries; the Great Southern &amp; Western
(Kingsbridge terminus) to Kilkenny, Athlone and Cork; the
Midland Great Western (Broadstone terminus), to Cavan, Sligo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page621" id="page621"></a>621</span>
and Galway; the Dublin &amp; South-Eastern (Harcourt Street
and Westland Row for Kingstown); and there is the North Wall
station of the London &amp; North-Western, with the line known
as the North Wall extension, connecting with the other main
lines. The internal communications of the city are excellent,
electric tramways traversing the principal streets, and connecting
all the principal suburbs.</p>

<p><i>Trade.</i>&mdash;Dublin was for long stigmatized as lacking, for so
large a city, in the proper signs of commercial enterprise. A
certain spirit of foolish pride was said to exist which sought
to disown trade; and the tendency to be poor and genteel in
the civil service, at the bar, in the constabulary, in the army,
in professional life, rather than prosperous in business, was one
of the most unfortunate and strongly marked characteristics of
Dublin society. This was attributable to the lingering yet
potent influence of an unhappy past was held by some; while
others attributed the weakness to the viceregal office and the
effects of a sham court. About the time of the Revolution, the
woollen trade flourished in Dublin, and the produce attained
great celebrity. The cheapness of labour attracted capitalists,
who started extensive factories in that quarter of the town
known even now as the Liberties. This quarter was inhabited
altogether by workers in wool, and as the city was small, the
aristocracy lived close by in noble mansions which are now miserable
memorials of past prosperity. About 1700 the English
legislature prevailed on William III. to assent to laws which
directly crushed the Irish trade. All exportation except to
England was peremptorily forbidden, and the woollen manufacture
soon decayed. But at the close of the 18th century
there were 5000 persons at work in the looms of the Liberties.
About 1715 parliament favoured the manufacture of linen, and
the Linen Hall was built. The cotton trade was soon afterwards
introduced; and silk manufacture was begun by the Huguenots,
who had settled in Dublin in considerable numbers after the
revocation of the edict of Nantes. Acts favourable to these
enterprises were passed, and they flourished apace. But the
old <span class="correction" title="amended from jealously">jealousy</span> arose in the reign of George I., and in the reign of
George III. an act was passed which tended directly to the ruin
of the manufacture. The linen shared the same fate. Dublin
poplins, however, keep their reputation. However adverse
influences may have been combated, Dublin yet produces little
for export save whisky and porter, the latter from the famous
Guinness brewery and others; but a considerable export trade,
principally in agricultural produce, passes through Dublin from
the country. The total annual export trade may be valued at
about £120,000, while imports exceed in value £3,000,000. To
the manufacturing industries of the city there should be added
mineral water works, foundries and shipbuilding.</p>

<p>By continual dredging a great depth of water is kept available
in the harbour. The Dublin Port and Docks Board, which was
created in 1898 and consists of the mayor and six
members of the corporation, with other members
<span class="sidenote">Harbour.</span>
representing the trading and shipping interests, undertook
considerable works of improvement at the beginning of the
20th century. These improvements, <i>inter alia</i>, enabled vessels
drawing up to 23 ft. to lie alongside the extensive quays which
border the Liffey, at low tide. The extensive Alexandra tidal
basin, on the north side of the Liffey, admits vessels of similar
capacity. The Custom House Works on the north side have about
17 ft. of water. With docks named after them are connected
the Royal and Grand Canals, passing respectively to north and
south of the city, the one penetrating the great central plain of
Ireland on the north, the other following the course of the Liffey,
doing the same on the south, and both joining the river Shannon.
The docks attached to the canals, and certain other smaller
docks, are owned by companies, and tolls are levied on vessels
entering these, but not those entering the docks under the Board.</p>

<p><i>Government.</i>&mdash;Dublin was formerly represented by two
members in the imperial parliament, but in 1885 the parliamentary
borough was divided into the four divisions of College
Green, Harbour, St Stephen&rsquo;s Green and St Patrick&rsquo;s, each
returning one member. The lord-lieutenant of Ireland occupies
Dublin Castle and the Viceregal Lodge in Phoenix Park. Dublin
is thus the seat of the viceregal court. It is also the seat of the
Irish courts of law and equity. In connexion with these it may
be noted that in 1904 a special court was established for children.
On the constitution of Dublin as a county borough in 1898, the
positions and duties of its corporation were left practically
unaltered. The corporation consists of a lord mayor, 20 aldermen
and 60 councillors, representing 20 wards. The income of the
body arises from rents on property, customs and taxes. Under an
act passed in 1875 the corporation has the right to forward every
year three names of persons suitable for the office of high sheriff
to the viceroy, one of which shall be selected by him. The
corporation has neither control over the police nor any judicial
duties, excepting as regards a court of conscience dealing with
debts under 40s. (Irish); while the lord mayor holds a court
for debts over 40s., and for the settlement of cases between
masters and servants. The lord mayor is clerk of the markets
and supervises weights and measures and deals with cases of
adulteration. Besides the usual duties of local government,
and the connexion with the port and docks boards already
explained, there should be noticed the connexion of the corporation
with such bodies as those controlling the city technical
schools, the Royal Irish Academy of Music, and the gallery of
modern art. The corporation has shown some concern for the
housing of the poor, and an extensive scheme taken up in 1904
included the provision of cottage dwellings in the suburbs, as at
Clontarf, besides improvements within the city itself. In 1905
a home on the model of the Rowton Houses in London, provided
by Lord Iveagh, was opened in Bride Road. A competent
fire-brigade is maintained by the corporation. The city coroner
is a corporate officer. The city hall, used as municipal offices, has
already been mentioned; the official residence of the lord mayor
is the Mansion House, Dawson Street. The Dublin metropolitan
police is a force peculiar to the city, the remainder of Ireland being
protected civilly by the Royal Irish Constabulary. A large
military force is usually maintained in the city of Dublin,
which is the headquarters of the military district of Dublin and
of the staff of Ireland (<i>q.v.</i>). The troops are accommodated in
several large barracks in various parts of the city.</p>

<p><i>Charities.</i>&mdash;The number of charitable institutions is large.
The hospital and Free School of King Charles I., commonly
called the Blue Coat hospital, was founded in 1670. It is devoted
to the education and maintenance of the sons of citizens in
poor circumstances. Before the Irish Parliament Houses were
erected the parliament met in the school building. Among
hospitals those of special general interest are the Steevens,
the oldest in the city, founded under the will of Dr Richard
Steevens in 1720; the Mater Misericordiae (1861), which includes
a laboratory and museum, and is managed by the Sisters of
Mercy, but relieves sufferers independently of their creed; the
Rotunda lying-in hospital (1756); the Royal hospital for incurables,
Donnybrook, which was founded in 1744 by the Dublin
Musical Society; and the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear hospital,
Adelaide Road, which amalgamated (1904) two similar institutions.
Lunatics are maintained in St Patrick&rsquo;s hospital, founded
in 1745, pursuant to the will of Dean Swift, and conducted by
governors appointed under the charter of incorporation. The
Richmond lunatic asylum, erected near the House of Industry,
and placed under the care of officers appointed by government,
receives patients from a district consisting of the counties of
Dublin, Louth, Meath and Wicklow, each of these contributing
towards its expenses in proportion to the number of patients
sent in. Besides these public establishments for the custody of
lunatics, there are in the vicinity of Dublin various private
asylums. The principal institution for blind men (and also those
afflicted by gout) is Simpson&rsquo;s hospital (1780), founded by a
merchant of Dublin; while blind women are maintained at
the Molyneux asylum (1815). An institution for the maintenance
and education of children born deaf and dumb is maintained
at Claremont, near Glasnevin (1816). The plan of the Royal
hospital, for old and maimed soldiers, was first suggested by the
earl of Essex, when lord-lieutenant, and carried into effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page622" id="page622"></a>622</span>
through the repeated applications of the duke of Ormond to
Charles II. The site chosen for it was that of the ancient priory
of Kilmainham, founded by Strongbow for Knights Templars.
The building, completed in 1684, according to a plan of Sir
Christopher Wren, is an oblong, three sides of which are dwelling-rooms,
connected by covered corridors. The fourth contains the
chapel, the dining-hall, and the apartments of the master, who
is always the commander of the forces for the time being. The
Royal Hibernian military school in Phoenix Park (1765) provides
for soldiers&rsquo; orphan sons. The Drummond Institution, Chapelizod,
for the orphan daughters of soldiers, was established in 1864 by
John Drummond, alderman, who left £20,000 to found the asylum.
The Hibernian Marine Society for the maintenance of seamen&rsquo;s
sons was established in the city in 1766, but now has buildings at
Clontarf. The Roman Catholic Church has charge of a number
of special charities, some of them educational and some for the
relief of suffering.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The name of Dublin signifies the &ldquo;Black pool.&rdquo;
The early history is mainly legendary. It is recorded that the
inhabitants of Leinster were defeated by the people of Dublin
in the year 291. Christianity was introduced by St Patrick
about 450. In the 9th century the Danes attacked Dublin and
took it. The first Norseman who may be reckoned as king was
Thorkel I. (832), though the Danes had appeared in the country
as early as the close of the previous century. Thorkel established
himself strongly at Armagh. In 1014 Brian Boroihme, king of
Munster, attacked the enemy and fought the battle of Clontarf,
in which he and his son and 11,000 of his followers fell. The Irish,
however, won the battle, but the Danes reoccupied the city.
Constant struggles with the Irish resulted in intermissions of
the Danish supremacy from 1052 to 1072, at various intervals
between 1075 and 1118 and from 1124 to 1136. The Danes were
finally ousted by the Anglo-Normans in 1171. In 1172 Henry II.
landed at Waterford, and came to Dublin and held his court there
in a pavilion of wickerwork where the Irish chiefs were entertained
with great pomp, and alliances entered into with them. Previous
to his departure for England, Henry bestowed the government
on Hugh de Lacy, having granted by charter &ldquo;to his subjects
of Bristol his city of Dublin to inhabit, and to hold of him and
his heirs for ever, with all the liberties and free customs which
his subjects of Bristol then enjoyed at Bristol and through
all England.&rdquo; In 1176 Strongbow, earl of Pembroke, and chief
leader of the Anglo-Norman forces, died in Dublin of a mortification
in one of his feet, and was buried in Christ Church Cathedral,
where his monument remains well preserved. A fresh charter
was granted in 1207 by King John to the inhabitants of Dublin,
who had not yet made their peace with the neighbourhood, but,
like the settlers in other towns, were at constant feud with the
native Irish; so that two years after the date of this charter,
whilst the citizens of Dublin were celebrating Easter at Cullenswood,
they were set upon by the Irish of the neighbouring
mountains, and 500 of them killed. The scene of slaughter is
still called the Bloody Fields, and Easter Monday denominated
Black Monday. On each succeeding anniversary of that day,
with the prevalent desire of perpetuating a feud, the citizens
marched out to Cullenswood with banners displayed&mdash;&ldquo;a terror
to the native Irish.&rdquo; In 1216 Magna Carta, a copy of which is
to be found in the Red Book of the Exchequer, was granted
to the Irish by Henry III. In 1217 the fee farm of the city was
granted to the citizens at a rent of 200 marks per annum; and
about this period many monastic buildings were founded. In
1227 the same monarch confirmed the charter of John fixing
the city boundaries and the jurisdiction of its magistrates.</p>

<p>During the invasion of Ireland by Edward Bruce in 1315
some of the suburbs of Dublin were burnt to prevent them
from falling into his hand. The inroad of Bruce had been countenanced
by the native Irish ecclesiastics, whose sentiments were
recorded in a statement addressed to Pope John XXII. Some
notion of the defence made against Bruce&rsquo;s invasion may be
gained from the fact that the churches were torn down to supply
stones for the building of the city walls. Bruce had seized
Greencastle on his march; but the natives re-took the town,
and brought to Dublin the governor who had yielded to Bruce.
He was starved to death.</p>

<p>Richard II. erected Dublin into a marquisate in favour of
Robert de Vere, whom he also created duke of Ireland. The same
monarch entered Dublin in 1394 with 30,000 bowmen and 4000
cavalry, bringing with him the crown jewels; but after holding
a parliament and making much courtly display before the native
chieftains, on several of whom he conferred knighthood, he
returned to England. Five years later, enriched with the spoils of
his uncle, John of Gaunt, Richard returned to Ireland, landing at
Waterford, whence he marched through the counties of Kilkenny
and Wicklow, and subsequently arrived in Dublin, where he
remained a fortnight, sumptuously entertained by the provost, as
the chief magistrate of the city was then called, till intelligence
of the invasion of his kingdom by Bolingbroke recalled him to
England.</p>

<p>In 1534 Lord Thomas Fitzgerald, better known as Silken
Thomas (so called because of a fantastic fringe worn in the helmet
of his followers), a young man of rash courage and good abilities,
son of the Lord Deputy Kildare, believing his father, who was
imprisoned in the Tower of London, to have been beheaded,
organized a rebellion against the English Government, and
marched with his followers from the mansion of the earls of
Kildare in Thomas Court, through Dame&rsquo;s Gate to St Mary&rsquo;s
Abbey, where, in the council chamber, he proclaimed himself
a rebel. On his appearing before the wall with a powerful force,
the citizens were induced through fear to give admission to a
detachment of his troops to besiege the castle; but, on hearing
that he had met with a reverse in another quarter, they suddenly
closed their gates and detained his men as prisoners. He then
attacked the city itself; but, finding it too strong to be seized
by a <i>coup de main</i>, he raised the siege on condition of having
his captured soldiers exchanged for the children of some of the
principal citizens who had fallen into his hands. After much
vicissitude of fortune, Lord Thomas and others concerned in this
rebellion were executed at Tyburn in 1536.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of civil war in 1641, a conspiracy of the
Irish septs, under the direction of Roger Moore, to seize Dublin
Castle, was disclosed by one Owen Connolly on the eve of the day
on which the attempt was to have been made, and the city was
thus preserved for the king&rsquo;s party; but the Irish outside began
an indiscriminate extermination of the Protestant population.
In 1646 Dublin was besieged, but without success, by the Irish
army of 16,000 foot and 1600 horse, under the guidance of the
Pope&rsquo;s nuncio Rinuccini and others, banded together &ldquo;to
restore and establish in Ireland the exercise of the Roman
Catholic religion.&rdquo; The city had been put in an efficient state of
defence by the marquess of Ormonde, then lord-lieutenant; but
in the following year, to prevent it falling into the hands of the
Irish, he surrendered it on conditions to Colonel Jones, commander
of the Parliamentary forces. In 1649 Ormonde was
totally defeated at the battle of Baggotrath, near Old Rathmines,
in an attempt to recover possession. The same year Cromwell
landed in Dublin, as commander-in-chief under the parliament,
with 9000 foot and 4000 horse, and proceeded thence on his
career of conquest.</p>

<p>When James II. landed in Ireland in 1689 to assert his right
to the British throne, he held a parliament in Dublin, which
passed acts of attainder against upwards of 3000 Protestants.
The governor of the city, Colonel Luttrell, at the same time issued
a proclamation ordering all Protestants not housekeepers, excepting
those following some trade, to depart from the city within
24 hours, under pain of death or imprisonment, and in various
ways restricting those who were allowed to remain. In the
hope of relieving his financial difficulties, the king erected a mint,
where money was coined of the &ldquo;worst kind of old brass, guns
and the refuse of metals, melted down together,&rdquo; of the nominal
value of £1,568,800, with which his troops were paid, and tradesmen
were compelled to receive it under penalty of being hanged
in case of refusal. Under these regulations the entire coinage
was put into circulation. After his defeat at the battle of the
Boyne, James returned to Dublin, but left it again before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page623" id="page623"></a>623</span>
daybreak the next day; and William III. advancing by slow
marches, on his arrival encamped at Finglas, with upwards of
30,000 men, and the following day proceeded in state to St
Patrick&rsquo;s cathedral to return thanks for his victory.</p>

<p>In 1783 a convention of delegates from all the volunteer corps
in Ireland assembled in Dublin for the purpose of procuring a
reform in parliament; but the House of Commons refused to
entertain the proposition, and the convention separated without
coming to any practical result. In May 1798 the breaking out of
a conspiracy planned by the United Irishmen to seize the city
was prevented by the capture of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, son
of the duke of Leinster and husband of the celebrated &ldquo;Pamela.&rdquo;
Lord Edward died in prison of the wounds received in the
encounter which preceded his capture. In 1803 an insurrection
headed by Robert Emmett, a young barrister of much promise,
broke out, but was immediately quelled, with the loss of some
lives in the tumult, and the death of its leaders on the scaffold.
In 1848 William Smith O&rsquo;Brien, M.P. for Limerick, raised a
rebellion in Tipperary, and the lower classes in Dublin were
greatly agitated. Owing, however, to timely and judicious
disposition of the military and police forces the city was saved
from much bloodshed. In 1867 the most serious of modern
conspiracies, that known as the Fenian organization, came to
light. The reality of it was proved by a ship being found laden
with gunpowder in the Liverpool docks, and another with £5000
and 2000 pike-heads in Dublin. The Habeas Corpus Act was
suspended at one sitting by both Houses of Parliament and
about 960 arrests were made in Dublin in a few hours. Dublin
castle was fortified; and the citizens lived in a state of terror
for several weeks together. For later history, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ireland</a></span>.</p>
